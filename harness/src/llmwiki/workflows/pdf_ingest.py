"""Map and integrate workflows for chunked (PDF) ingest.

Guardrail contracts:
- map: must search_wiki and write_page before finish_chunk — every chunk
  leaves real knowledge in the wiki, not just notes. No read_source tool,
  so the model cannot pull the whole book into context.
- integrate: must write_page (the hub source page) before finish_ingest.
