"""The three wiki operations as forge Workflows.

Guardrail contracts (enforced by forge's StepEnforcer, not by prompting):
- ingest: must read_source and write_page before finish_ingest; write_page
  is gated on a prior read_source.
- query: must search_wiki before respond (index-first navigation).
- lint: must read_page before finish_lint (no drive-by sign-off).
