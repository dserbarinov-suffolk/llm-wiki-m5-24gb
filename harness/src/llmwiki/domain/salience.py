"""Deterministic salience: which pages matter most, computed, never recalled.

Metric v2 (docs/open-questions.md #12 — each element fixes a measured
failure of v1):
- inbound `[[link]]` counts, EXCLUDING links from the hub being rebuilt —
  v1's hub fed the ranking that wrote the next hub (feedback loop);
- per-page write counts recorded during the ingest;
- term frequency of the page's name in the source text itself — the only
  signal that has read the book (iterable: 199 mentions vs a foreword
  author's 4); log-scaled so it informs without erasing the wiki signals;
- eligibility scoped to pages that cite the source — v1 ranked an
  Antikythera entity in a JavaScript book's report.

Pure data-in/data-out, mirroring `compute_findings`.
