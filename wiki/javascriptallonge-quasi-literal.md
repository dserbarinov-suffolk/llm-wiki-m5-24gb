# Quasi Literal

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about quasi literal:

## Statements

### A Warm Cup: Basic Strings and Quasi-Literals / quasi-literals

- JavaScript supports quasi-literal strings , a/k/a 'Template Strings' or 'String Interpolation Expressions.' A quasi-literal string is something that looks like a string literal, but is actually an expression. Quasi-literal strings are denoted with back quotes, and most strings that can be expressed as literals have the exact same meaning as quasi-literals, e.g. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01477))_

- Quasi-literals go much further. A quasi-literal can contain an expression to be evaluated. Old-school lispers call this 'unquoting,' the more contemporary term is 'interpolation.' An unquoted expression is inserted in a quasi-literal with ${expression} . The expression is evaluated, and the result is coerced to a string, then inserted in the quasi-string. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01479))_

- However, there is a big semantic difference between a quasi-literal and an expression. Quasi-literals are expressions that resemble their result. They're easier to read and it's easier to avid errors like the following: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01485))_

### A Warm Cup: Basic Strings and Quasi-Literals / evaluation time

- Like any other expression, quasi-literals are evaluated late , when that line or lines of code is evaluated. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01488))_

- JavaScript evaluates the quasi-literal when the function is invoked and the quasi-literal inside the function's body is evaluated. Thus, name is not bound to "Harry" , it is bound to 'Arthur Dent' , the value of the parameter when the function is invoked. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01491))_
