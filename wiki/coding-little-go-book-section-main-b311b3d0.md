# Main

From [[coding-little-go-book]].

## Technical atoms

> For now, while we focus on understanding the basics of Go, we'll always write our code within the main package.

> Hopefully, the code that we just executed is understandable. We've created a function and printed out a string with the built-in println function. Did go run know what to execute because there was only a single choice? No. In Go, the entry point to a program has to be a function called main within a package main . We'll talk more about packages in a later chapter. For now, while we focus on understanding the basics of Go, we'll always write our code within the main package. If you want, you can alter the code and change the package name. Run the code via go run and you should get an error. Then, change the name back to main but use a different function name. You should see a different error message. Try making those same changes but use go build instead. Notice that the code compiles, there's just no entry point to run it. This is perfectly normal when you are, for example, building a library.
