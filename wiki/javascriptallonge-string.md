# String

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about string:

## Statements

### values are expressions

- First, sometimes, the cups are of different kinds. One is a demitasse, the other a mug. This corresponds to comparing two things in JavaScript that have different types . For example, the string "2" is not the same thing as the number 2 . Strings and numbers are different types, so strings and numbers are never identical: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00116))_

### As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less

- In JavaScript, functions are values, but they are also much more than simple numbers, strings, or even complex data structures like trees or maps. Functions represent computations to be performed. Like numbers, strings, and arrays, they have a representation. Let's start with the second simplest possible function. 16 In JavaScript, it looks like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00162))_

### undefined

- Like numbers, booleans and strings, JavaScript can print out the value undefined . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00214))_

### call by sharing

- We said that JavaScript binds names to values, but we didn't say what it means to bind a name to a value. Now we can elaborate: When JavaScript binds a value-type to a name, it makes a copy of the value and places the copy in the environment. As you recall, value types like strings and numbers are identical to each other if they have the same content. So JavaScript can make as many copies of strings, numbers, or booleans as it wishes. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00308))_

### Arrays and Destructuring Arguments

- While we have mentioned arrays briefly, we haven't had a close look at them. Arrays are JavaScript's 'native' representation of lists. Strings are important because they represent writing. Lists are important because they represent ordered collections of things, and ordered collections are a fundamental abstraction for making sense of reality. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00798))_

### A Warm Cup: Basic Strings and Quasi-Literals

- String manipulation is extremely common in programming. Writing is a big part of what makes us human, and strings are how JavaScript and most other languages represent writing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01475))_

### quasi-literals

- JavaScript supports quasi-literal strings , a/k/a 'Template Strings' or 'String Interpolation Expressions.' A quasi-literal string is something that looks like a string literal, but is actually an expression. Quasi-literal strings are denoted with back quotes, and most strings that can be expressed as literals have the exact same meaning as quasi-literals, e.g. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01477))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: values are expressions

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00118))_

> Second, sometimes, the cups are of the same type-perhaps two espresso cups-but they have different contents. One holds a single, one a double. This corresponds to comparing two JavaScript values that have the same type but different 'content.' For example, the number 5 is not the same thing as the number 2 .

2 In JavaScript, we test whether two values are identical with the operator, and whether they are === not identical with the operator: !== 2 === 2 //=> true 'hello' !== 'goodbye' //=> true How does work, exactly? Imagine that you’re shown a cup of coffee. And then you’re shown === another cup of coffee. Are the two cups “identical?” In JavaScript, there are four possibilities: First, sometimes, the cups are of different kinds. One is a demitasse, the other a mug. This corresponds to comparing two things in JavaScript that have different types. For example, the string "2" is not the same thing as the number 2. Strings and numbers are different types, so strings and numbers are never identical:
2 === '2' //=> false true !== 'true' //=> true Second, sometimes, the cups are of the same type–perhaps two espresso cups–but they have different contents. One holds a single, one a double. This corresponds to comparing two JavaScript values that have the same type but different “content.” For example, the number 5 is not the same thing as the number 2. true === false //=> false
2 !== 5 //=> true 'two' === 'five' //=> false What if the cups are of the same type and the contents are the same? Well, JavaScript’s third and fourth possibilities cover that. Prelude: Values and Expressions over Coffee xvii value types Third, some types of cups have no distinguishing marks on them. If they are the same kind of cup, and they hold the same contents, we have no way to tell the difference between them. This is the case with the strings, numbers, and booleans we have seen so far.
2 + 2 === 4 //=> true (2 + 2 === 4) === (2 !== 5) //=> true Note well what is happening with these examples: Even when we obtain a string, number, or boolean as the result of evaluating an expression, it is identical to another value of the same type with the same “content.” Strings, numbers, and booleans are examples of what JavaScript calls “value” or “primitive” types. We’ll use both terms interchangeably. We haven’t encountered the fourth possibility yet. Stretching the metaphor somewhat, some types of cups have a serial number on the bottom. So even if you have two cups of the same type, and their contents are the same, you can still distinguish between them. Cafe Macchiato is also a fine drink, especially when following up on the fortunes of the Azzurri or the standings in the Giro d’Italia reference types So what kinds of values might be the same type and have the same contents, but not be considered identical to JavaScript? Let’s meet a data structure that is very common in contemporary programming languages, the Array (other languages sometimes call it a List or a Vector). Prelude: Values and Expressions over Coffee xviii An array looks like this: [1, 2, 3]. This is an expression, and you can combine [] with other expressions. Go wild with things like: [2-1, 2, 2+1] [1, 1+1, 1+1+1] Notice that you are always generating arrays with the same contents. But are they identical the same way that every value of is identical to every other value of 42? Try these for yourself: 42 [2-1, 2, 2+1] === [1,2,3] [1,2,3] === [1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3] How about that! When you type or any of its variations, you are typing an expression [1, 2, 3] that generates its own unique array that is not identical to any other array, even if that other array also looks like 3]. It’s as if JavaScript is generating new cups of coffee with serial numbers [1, 2, on the bottom. They look the same, but if you examine them with ===, you see that they are different. Every time you evaluate an expression (including typing something in) to create an array, you’re creating a new, distinct value even if it appears to be the same as some other array value. As we’ll see, this is true of many other kinds of values, including functions, the main subject of this book.

### Technical frame 5: quasi-literals

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01479))_

> Quasi-literals go much further. A quasi-literal can contain an expression to be evaluated. Old-school lispers call this 'unquoting,' the more contemporary term is 'interpolation.' An unquoted expression is inserted in a quasi-literal with ${expression} . The expression is evaluated, and the result is coerced to a string, then inserted in the quasi-string.
