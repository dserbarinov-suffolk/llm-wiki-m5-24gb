## Statements

- The mapWith and foldWith functions we wrote in Self-Similarity are useful for illustrating the basic principles behind using recursion to work with self-similar data structures, but they are not 'production-ready' implementations. One of the reasons they are not production-ready is that they consume memory proportional to the size of the array being folded. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00948))_
- Let's step through its execution. First, mapWith((x) => x * x, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is invoked. first is not undefined , so it evaluates [fn(first), …mapWith(fn, rest)]. To do that, it has to evaluate fn(first) and mapWith(fn, rest) , then evaluate [fn(first), ...mapWith(fn, rest)] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00951))_
- Note that while evaluating mapWith(fn, rest) , JavaScript must retain the value first or fn(first) , plus some housekeeping information so it remembers what to do with mapWith(fn, rest) when it has a result. JavaScript cannot throw first away. So we know that JavaScript is going to hang on to 1 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00954))_
- Next, JavaScript invokes mapWith(fn, rest) , which is semantically equivalent to mapWith((x) => x * x, [2, 3, 4, 5]) . And the same thing happens: JavaScript has to hang on to 2 (or 4 , or both, depending on the implementation), plus some housekeeping information so it remembers what to do with that value, while it calls the equivalent of mapWith((x) => x * x, [3, 4, 5]) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00955))_
- This keeps on happening, so that JavaScript collects the values 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 plus housekeeping information by the time it calls mapWith((x) => x * x, []) . It can start assembling the resulting array and start discarding the information it is saving. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00956))_
- That information is saved on a call stack , and it is quite expensive. Furthermore, doubling the length of an array will double the amount of space we need on the stack, plus double all the work required to set up and tear down the housekeeping data for each call (these are called call frames , and they include the place where the function was called, an environment, and so on). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00957))_
- In practice, using a method like this with more than about 50 items in an array may cause some implementations to run very slow, run out of memory and freeze, or cause an error. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00958))_
- Is there a better way? Yes. In fact, there are several better ways. Making algorithms faster is a very highly studied field of computer science. The one we're going to look at here is called tail-call optimization , or 'TCO.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00960))_
- To do that, it has to evaluate fn(first) and mapWith(fn, rest) , then evaluate [fn(first), ...mapWith(fn, rest)] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00951))_

## Statements by subsection

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Tail Calls (and Default Arguments) / tail-call optimization

- A'tail-call' occurs when a function's last act is to invoke another function, and then return whatever the other function returns. For example, consider the maybe function decorator: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00962))_
- There are three places it returns. The first two don't return anything, they don't matter. But the third is fn.apply(this, args) . This is a tail-call, because it invokes another function and returns its result. This is interesting, because after sorting out what to supply as arguments ( this , args ), JavaScript can throw away everything in its current stack frame. It isn't going to do any more work, so it can throw its existing stack frame away. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00964))_
- And in fact, it does exactly that: It throws the stack frame away, and does not consume extra memory when making a maybe -wrapped call. This is a very important characteristic of JavaScript: If a function makes a call in tail position, JavaScript optimizes away the function call overhead and stack space. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00965))_
- That is excellent, but one wrapping is not a big deal. When would we really care? Consider this implementation of length : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00966))_
- The length function calls itself, but it is not a tail-call, because it returns 1 + length(rest) , not length(rest) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00968))_
- The problem can be stated in such a way that the answer is obvious: length does not call itself in tail position, because it has to do two pieces of work, and while one of them is in the recursive call to length , the other happens after the recursive call. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00969))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Tail Calls (and Default Arguments) / converting non-tail-calls to tail-calls

- The obvious solution is push the 1 + work into the call to length . Here's our first cut: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00972))_
- This lengthDelaysWork function calls itself in tail position. The 1 + work is done before calling itself, and by the time it reaches the terminal position, it has the answer. Now that we've seen how it works, we can clean up the 0 + numberToBeAdded business. But while we're doing that, it's annoying to remember to call it with a zero. Let's fix that: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00974))_
- This version of length calls uses lengthDelaysWork , and JavaScript optimizes that not to take up memory proportional to the length of the string. We can use this technique with mapWith : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00977))_
- Brilliant! We can map over large arrays without incurring all the memory and performance overhead of non-tail-calls. And this basic transformation from a recursive function that does not make a tail call, into a recursive function that calls itself in tail position, is a bread-and-butter pattern for programmers using a language that incorporates tail-call optimization. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00981))_
