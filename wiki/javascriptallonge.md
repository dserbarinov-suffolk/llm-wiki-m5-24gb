## About JavaScript Allongé

- It's written in JavaScript, because JavaScript hits the perfect sweet spot of being both widely used, and of having proper first-class functions with lexical scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00014))_
- JavaScript Allongé is a first and foremost, a book about programming with functions . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00014))_
- It's written in JavaScript, because JavaScript hits the perfect sweet spot of being both widely used, and of having proper first-class functions with lexical scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00014))_
- JavaScript Allongé begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, collections, iterators, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00015))_
- JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript's power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00016))_
- It also provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00016))_

## why the 'six' edition?

- Features like destructuring, block-structured variables, iterables, generators, and the class keyword are poised to make JavaScript programming more expressive. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00019))_
- And the variable i is scoped locally to the code within the braces. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00023))_
- Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not support block-structuring, so programmers borrowed a trick from the Scheme programming language, and would write: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00023))_

- And the variable i is scoped locally to the code within the braces. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00023))_
- Likewise, many programming languages permit functions to have a variable number of arguments, and to collect the arguments into a single variable as an array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00026))_
- Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not support collecting a variable number of arguments into a parameter, so programmers would take advantage of an awkward work-around and write things like: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00028))_
- Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not support collecting a variable number of arguments into a parameter, so programmers would take advantage of an awkward work-around and write things like: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00028))_
- The first edition of JavaScript Allongé explained these and many other patterns for writing flexible and composable programs in JavaScript, but the intention wasn't to explain how to work around JavaScript's missing features: The intention was to explain why the style of programming exemplified by the missing features is important. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00030))_
- Working around the missing features was a necessary evil. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00031))_
- But now, JavaScript is gaining many important features, in part because the governing body behind JavaScript has observed that programmers are constantly working around the same set of limitations. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00032))_
- But now, JavaScript is gaining many important features, in part because the governing body behind JavaScript has observed that programmers are constantly working around the same set of limitations. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00032))_
- And i is scoped to the for loop. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00034))_
- JavaScript Allongé, The 'Six' Edition packs all the goodness of JavaScript Allongé into a new, updated package that is relevant for programmers working with (or planning to work with) the latest version of JavaScript. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00037))_

> ECMAScript 2015 (formerly called ECMAScript 6 or 'ES6'), is ushering in a very large number of improvements to the way programmers can write small, powerful components and combine them into larger, fully featured programs.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00019))_

> Prior to ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript did not include many features that programmers have discovered are vital to writing great software. For example, JavaScript did not include block-structured variables. Over time, programmers discovered ways to roll their own versions of important features.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00020))_

> For example, block-structured languages allow us to write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00021))_

```
for ( int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) { // ... }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00022))_

```
var i; for (i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) { ( function (i) { // ... })(i) }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00024))_

> In Ruby, we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00026))_

```
def foo (first, *rest) # ... end
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00027))_

```
function foo () { var first = arguments[0], rest = [].slice.call(arguments, 1); // ... }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00029))_

> With ECMASCript 2015, we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00032))_

```
for ( let i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) { // ... }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00033))_

> We can also write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00034))_

```
function foo (first, ...rest) { // ... }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00035))_

> Not having to work around these kinds of missing features makes JavaScript Allongé a better book , because it can focus on the why to do something and when to do it, instead of on the how to make it work
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00036))_

## that's nice. is that the only reason?

- If it were just a matter of updating the syntax, the original version of JavaScript Allongé could have simply iterated, slowly replacing old syntax with new. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00040))_
- The original JavaScript Allongé was not just written to teach JavaScript: It was written to describe certain ideas in programming: Working with small, independent entities that compose together to make bigger programs. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00041))_
- Thus, the focus on things like writing decorators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00041))_
- As noted above, JavaScript was chosen as the language for Allongé because it hit a sweet spot of having a large audience of programmers and having certain language features that happen to work well with this style of programming. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00042))_
- As noted above, JavaScript was chosen as the language for Allongé because it hit a sweet spot of having a large audience of programmers and having certain language features that happen to work well with this style of programming. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00042))_
- It makes a number of interesting programming techniques easy to explain and easy to use. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00043))_
- ECMAScript 2015 does more than simply update the language with some simpler syntax for a few things and help us avoid warts. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00043))_
- Thus, the 'six' edition introduces classes and mixins. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00044))_
- And introducing these new ideas did add substantially to its bulk. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00046))_
- But even so, in a way it is still explaining the exact same original idea that programs are built out of small, flexible functions composed together. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00046))_
- Introducing so many new ideas did require a major rethink of the way the book was organized. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00046))_

> It would have continued to say much the same things, only with new syntax.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00040))_

> But the common thread that runs through all these things is that since they are all simple objects and simple functions, we can use the same set of 'programming with functions' techniques to build programs by composing small, flexible, and decoupled entities.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00044))_

## What JavaScript Allongé is. And isn't.

- JavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00049))_
- The intention is to improve the way we think about programs. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00050))_
- The focus in this book on the underlying ideas, what we might call the fundamentals, and how they combine to form new ideas. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00050))_
- But while JavaScript Allongé attempts to be provocative, it is not prescriptive . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00051))_
- Software development is a complex field. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00052))_
- The use of source-code control systems with integrated diffing rewards making certain types of focused changes. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00059))_
- Continuous integration encourages the creation of software in tandem with and factored to facilitate the creation of automated test suites. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00059))_
- The use of linters 1 makes checking for certain types of undesirable code very cheap. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00059))_
- Debuggers encourage the use of functions with explicit or implicit names. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00059))_
- JavaScript Allongé does not attempt to address the question of JavaScript best practices in the wider context of software development, because JavaScript Allongé isn't a book about practicing, it's a book about thinking. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00060))_
- JavaScript Allongé does not attempt to address the question of JavaScript best practices in the wider context of software development, because JavaScript Allongé isn't a book about practicing, it's a book about thinking. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00060))_

> There is absolutely no suggestion that any of the techniques shown here are the only way to do something, the best way, or even an acceptable way to write programs that are intended to be used, read, and maintained by others.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00051))_

> People often say that software should be written for people to read.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00052))_

> Choices in software development are also often driven by requirements specific to the type of software being developed. For example, business software written in-house has a very different set of requirements than a library written to be publicly distributed as open-source.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00053))_

> Choices in software development must also consider the question of consistency.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00054))_

> Choices in software development must also consider the question of consistency. If a particular codebase is written with lots of helper functions that place the subject first, like this:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00054))_

```
const mapWith = (iterable, fn) => ({ [Symbol.iterator]: function * () { for ( let element of iterable) { yield fn(element); } } });
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00055))_

> Then it can be jarring to add new helpers written that place the verb first, like this:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00056))_

```
const filterWith = (fn, iterable) => ({ [Symbol.iterator]: function * () { for ( let element of iterable) { if (!!fn(element)) yield element; } } });
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00057))_

> Finally, choices in software development cannot ignore the tooling that is used to create and maintain software.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00059))_

## how this book is organized

- Code examples within each chapter are small and emphasize exposition rather than serving as patterns for everyday use. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00062))_
- Code examples within each chapter are small and emphasize exposition rather than serving as patterns for everyday use. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00062))_
- Following some of the chapters are a series of recipes designed to show the application of the chapter's ideas in practical form. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00064))_

> While the content of each chapter builds naturally on what was discussed in the previous chapter, the recipes may draw upon any aspect of the JavaScript programming language.

## Foreword to the 'Six' edition

- That version was planned to have numerous new features (interfaces, namespaces, packages, multimethods, etc.), which would have turned JavaScript into a completely new language. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00066))_
- ECMAScript 6 (short name: ES6; official name: ECMAScript 2015) was ratified as a standard on June 17. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00066))_
- After internal conflict, a settlement was reached in July 2008 and a new plan was made - to abandon ECMAScript 4 and to replace it with two upgrades: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00066))_
- Getting there took a while - in a way, the origins of ES6 date back to the year 2000: After ECMAScript 3 was finished, TC39 (the committee evolving JavaScript) started to work on ECMAScript 4. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00066))_

- Getting there took a while - in a way, the origins of ES6 date back to the year 2000: After ECMAScript 3 was finished, TC39 (the committee evolving JavaScript) started to work on ECMAScript 4. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00066))_
- - A smaller upgrade would bring a few minor enhancements to ECMAScript 3. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00067))_
- This upgrade became ECMAScript 6 (some features that were initially discussed will show up later, in upcoming ECMAScript versions). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00068))_
- - A larger upgrade would substantially improve JavaScript, but without being as radical as ECMAScript 4. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00068))_

## ECMAScript 6 has three major groups of features:

- With ECMAScript 6, JavaScript has become much larger as a language. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00076))_
- JavaScript Allongé, the 'Six' Edition is both a comprehensive tour of its features and a rich collection of techniques for making better use of them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00076))_
- And you'll do so via ES6 code, handed to you in small, easily digestible pieces. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00076))_
- You will learn much about functional programming and object-oriented programming. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00076))_

> - Better syntax for features that already exist (e.g. via libraries). For example: classes and modules.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00070))_

> - New functionality in the standard library. For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00071))_

> - Completely new features. For example: Generators, proxies and WeakMaps.

## Forewords to the First Edition

## michael fogus

- However, Reg sent me a copy of his book and I was humbled. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00083))_
- As a life-long bibliophile and long-time follower of Reg's online work, I was excited when he started writing books. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00083))_
- The act of writing is an iterative process with (very often) tight revision loops. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00084))_
- On more than one occasion I've found myself attempting to reify feedback with content that either no longer existed or was changed beyond recognition. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00084))_
- However, the process of soliciting feedback, gathering responses, sending out copies, waiting for people to actually read it (if they ever do), receiving feedback and then ultimately making sense out of how to use it takes weeks and sometimes months. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00084))_
- However, the process of soliciting feedback, gathering responses, sending out copies, waiting for people to actually read it (if they ever do), receiving feedback and then ultimately making sense out of how to use it takes weeks and sometimes months. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00084))_
- No matter how much of an expert you think you are, JavaScript Allongé has something to teach you… about coffee. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00085))_
- While not exclusively a book about functional programming, JavaScript Allongé will provide a solid foundation for functional techniques. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00086))_
- As an author of programming books I admire what Reg has managed to accomplish and I envy the fine reader who finds JavaScript Allongé via some darkened channel in the Internet sprawl and reads it for the first time. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00086))_
- However, you'll not be beaten about the head and neck with dogma. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00086))_
- As a staunch advocate of functional programming, much of what Reg has written rings true to me. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00086))_

> Not only was this a great book, but it was also a great way to write and distribute books.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00083))_

> Reg has crafted (and continues to craft) not only an interesting book from the perspective of a connoisseur, but also an entertaining exploration into some of the most interesting aspects of his art.

## matthew knox

- A different kind of language requires a different kind of book. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00090))_
- JavaScript holds surprising depths-its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00091))_
- It starts with the fundamentals of values, functions, and objects, and then guides you through JavaScript from the inside with exploratory bits of code that illustrate scoping, combinators, context, state, prototypes, and constructors. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00091))_

## About The Sample PDF

- If you read JavaScript Allongé, The 'six' edition and it doesn't blow your mind, your money will be cheerfully refunded. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00097))_
- This sample edition of the book includes just a portion of the complete book. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00097))_
- No, this is not the author: But he has free coffee! _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00100))_

## Prelude: Values and Expressions over Coffee

## values are expressions

- You say, 'I want one of these.' The barista is no fool, she gives it straight back to you, and you get exactly what you want. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00108))_
- Yup, you hand over a cup with some coffee infused through partially caramelized sugar. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00108))_
- All values are expressions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00108))_
- The answer is, this is both an expression and a value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00112))_
- All values are expressions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00114))_
- Astute readers will realize we're omitting something. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00115))_
- Ground coffee is a value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00116))_
- 11 Boiling water is a value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00116))_
- Boiling water plus ground coffee is an expression. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00116))_
- So, boiling water plus ground coffee is an expression, but it isn't a value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00116))_
- You and I both understand that this means '42,' and so does the computer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00119))_
- You and I both understand that this means '42,' and so does the computer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00119))_
- The grandfather of such languages is Lisp. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00120))_
- JavaScript is not such a language, expressions in and of themselves are not values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00120))_

> Thus, a café Cubano is an expression (you can use it to place an order) and a value (you get it back from the barista).
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00108))_

> 10 The way you can tell that it's both is very easy: When you type it into JavaScript, you get the same thing back, just like our café Cubano:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00112))_

```
42 //=> 42
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00113))_

> Instead of handing over the finished coffee, we can hand over the ingredients.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00114))_

```
"JavaScript" + " " + "Allonge" //=> "JavaScript Allonge"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00118))_

> 11 In some languages, expressions are a kind of value unto themselves and can be manipulated.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00120))_

> Nowwesee that 'strings' are values, and you can make an expression out of strings and an operator + .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00121))_

> Nowwesee that 'strings' are values, and you can make an expression out of strings and an operator + . Since strings are values, they are also expressions by themselves. But strings with operators are not values, they are expressions. Now we know what was missing with our 'coffee grounds plus hot water' example. The coffee grounds were a value, the boiling hot water was a value, and the 'plus' operator between them made the whole thing an expression that was not a value.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00121))_

## values and identity

- And then you're shown another cup of coffee. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00125))_

```
2 === 2 //=> true 'hello' !== 'goodbye' //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00124))_

> Strings and numbers are different types, so strings and numbers are never identical:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00126))_

> First, sometimes, the cups are of different kinds. One is a demitasse, the other a mug. This corresponds to comparing two things in JavaScript that have different types . For example, the string "2" is not the same thing as the number 2 . Strings and numbers are different types, so strings and numbers are never identical:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00126))_

```
2 === '2' //=> false true !== 'true' //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00127))_

> Second, sometimes, the cups are of the same type-perhaps two espresso cups-but they have different contents. One holds a single, one a double. This corresponds to comparing two JavaScript values that have the same type but different 'content.' For example, the number 5 is not the same thing as the number 2 .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00128))_

```
true === false //=> false 2 !== 5 //=> true 'two' === 'five' //=> false
```

## value types

- If they are the same kind of cup, and they hold the same contents, we have no way to tell the difference between them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00132))_
- Third, some types of cups have no distinguishing marks on them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00132))_
- This is the case with the strings, numbers, and booleans we have seen so far. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00132))_
- We'll use both terms interchangeably. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00134))_
- Note well what is happening with these examples: Even when we obtain a string, number, or boolean as the result of evaluating an expression, it is identical to another value of the same type with the same 'content.' Strings, numbers, and booleans are examples of what JavaScript calls 'value' or 'primitive' types. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00134))_
- Cafe Macchiato is also a fine drink, especially when following up on the fortunes of the Azzurri or the standings in the Giro d'Italia _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00136))_

```
2 + 2 === 4 //=> true (2 + 2 === 4) === (2 !== 5) //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00133))_

> So even if you have two cups of the same type, and their contents are the same, you can still distinguish between them.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00135))_

## reference types

- When you type [1, 2, 3] or any of its variations, you are typing an expression that generates its own unique array that is not identical to any other array, even if that other array also looks like [1, 2, 3] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00143))_
- As we'll see, this is true of many other kinds of values, including functions , the main subject of this book. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00144))_
- They look the same, but if you examine them with === , you see that they are different. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00144))_
- Every time you evaluate an expression (including typing something in) to create an array, you're creating a new, distinct value even if it appears to be the same as some other array value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00144))_

> This is an expression, and you can combine [] with other expressions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00139))_

```
[2-1, 2, 2+1] [1, 1+1, 1+1+1]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00140))_

> Notice that you are always generating arrays with the same contents.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00141))_

```
[2-1, 2, 2+1] === [1,2,3] [1,2,3] === [1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00142))_

## A Rich Aroma: Basic Numbers

- Almost all programming languages have notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and usually for booleans and characters; some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00147))_
- In computer science, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00147))_
- Almost all programming languages have notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and usually for booleans and characters; some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00147))_
- We saw that an expression consisting solely of numbers, like 42 , is a literal. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00148))_
- If we start a literal with a zero, it is an octal literal. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00148))_
- It represents the number forty-two, which is 42 base 10. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00148))_
- Not all numbers are base ten. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00148))_
- So the literal 042 is 42 base 8, which is actually 34 base 10. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00148))_
- A computer's internal representation for numbers is important to understand. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00150))_
- Internally, both 042 and 34 have the same representation, as double-precision floating point 13 numbers. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00150))_

> The machine's representation of a number almost never lines up perfectly with our understanding of how a number behaves, and thus there will be places where the computer's behaviour surprises us if we don't know a little about what it's doing 'under the hood.'
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00150))_

> For example, the largest integer JavaScript can safely 14 handle is 9007199254740991 , or 2 '53' - 1 . Like most programming languages, JavaScript does not allow us to use commas to separate groups of digits.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00151))_

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00151))_

## floating

- It's tempting to think we now have everything we need to do things like handle amounts of money, but as the late John Belushi would say, 'Nooooooooooooooooooooo.' A computer's internal representation for a floating point number is binary, while our literal number was in base ten. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00154))_
- This makes no meaningful difference for integers, but it does for fractions, because some fractions base 10 do not have exact representations base 2. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00154))_
- This makes no meaningful difference for integers, but it does for fractions, because some fractions base 10 do not have exact representations base 2. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00154))_

> Most programmers never encounter the limit on the magnitude of an integer. But we mentioned that numbers are represented internally as floating point, meaning that they need not be just integers. We can, for example, write 1.5 or 33.33 , and JavaScript represents these literals as floating point numbers.

> 14 Implementations of JavaScript are free to handle larger numbers. For example, if you type 9007199254740991 + 9007199254740991 into node.js , it will happily report that the answer is 18014398509481982 .

> This kind of 'inexactitude' can be ignored when performing calculations that have an acceptable deviation.

> But as a rule, if you need to work with real numbers, you should have more than a nodding acquaintance with the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic 15 . Professional programmers almost never use floating point numbers to represent monetary amounts. For example, '$43.21' will nearly always be presented as two numbers: 43 for dollars and 21 for cents, not 43.21 . In this book, we need not think about such details, but outside of this book, we must.

## operations on numbers

- In JavaScript, operators have an order of precedence designed to mimic the way humans typically parse written arithmetic. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00165))_

> As we've seen, JavaScript has many common arithmetic operators. We can create expressions that look very much like mathematical expressions, for example we can write 1 + 1 or 2 * 3 or 42 34 or even 6 / 2 . These can be combined to make more complex expressions, like 2 * 5 + 1 .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00164))_

```
2 * 5 + 1 //=> 11 1 + 5 * 2 //=> 11
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00166))_

> JavaScript treats the expressions as if we had written (2 * 5) + 1 and 1 + (5 * 2) , because the * operator has a higher precedence than the + operator. JavaScript has many more operators. In a sense, they behave like little functions. If we write 1 + 2 , this is conceptually similar to writing plus(1, 2) (assuming we have a function that adds two numbers bound to the name plus , of course).
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00167))_

> There are lots and lots more operators that can be used with numbers, including bitwise operators like | and & that allow you to operate directly on a number's binary representation, and a number of other operators that perform assignment or logical comparison that we will look at later.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00170))_

## The first sip: Basic Functions

## As Little As Possible About Functions, But No Less

- Functions represent computations to be performed. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00173))_
- Like numbers, strings, and arrays, they have a representation. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00173))_
- In JavaScript, functions are values, but they are also much more than simple numbers, strings, or even complex data structures like trees or maps. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00173))_
- This is a function that is applied to no values and returns 0 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00175))_
- The simplest and easiest answer is that although the JavaScript interpreter does indeed return that value, displaying it on the screen is a slightly different matter. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00177))_
- This seems to break our rule that if an expression is also a value, JavaScript will give the same value back to us. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00177))_
- But we must understand that whether we see [Function] or () => 0 , internally JavaScript has a full and proper function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00179))_

```
() => 0
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00174))_

```
(() => 0) //=> [Function]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00176))_

> If you try the same thing in a browser, you may see something else.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00177))_

> I'd prefer something else, but I must accept that what gets typed back to us on the screen is arbitrary, and all that really counts is that it is somewhat useful for a human to read.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00179))_

## functions and identities

- Reference types do not. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00181))_
- Value types share the same identity if they have the same contents. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00181))_
- You recall that we have two types of values with respect to identity: Value types and reference types. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00181))_
- Like arrays, every time you evaluate an expression to produce a function, you get a new function that is not identical to any other function, even if you use the same expression to generate it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00184))_

```
(() => 0) === (() => 0) //=> false
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00183))_

## applying functions

- We'll put it in parentheses 17 to keep the parser happy, like we did above: (() => 0) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00189))_
- Since we aren't giving it any arguments, we'll simply write () after the expression. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00189))_
- 17 If you're used to other programming languages, you've probably internalized the idea that sometimes parentheses are used to group operations in an expression like math, and sometimes to apply a function to arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00191))_

> Let's put functions to work. The way we use functions is to apply them to zero or more values called arguments . Just as 2 + 2 produces a value (in this case 4 ), applying a function to zero or more arguments produces a value as well.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00186))_

```
fn_expr ( args )
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00188))_

> Right now, we only know about one such expression: () => 0 , so let's use it.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00189))_

```
(() => 0)() //=> 0
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00190))_

## functions that return values and evaluate expressions

- We know that (() => 0)() returns 0 , and this is unsurprising. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00193))_
- Functions can return the value of evaluating another function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00201))_

> Likewise, the following all ought to be obvious:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00193))_

```
(() => 1)() //=> 1 (() => "Hello, JavaScript")() //=> "Hello, JavaScript" (() => Infinity )() //=> Infinity
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00194))_

> Well, the last one's a doozy, but still, the general idea is this: We can make a function that returns a value by putting the value to the right of the arrow.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00195))_

> In the prelude, we looked at expressions. Values like 0 are expressions, as are things like 40 + 2 . Can we put an expression to the right of the arrow?
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00196))_

> Can we put an expression to the right of the arrow?
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00196))_

```
(() => 1 + 1)() //=> 2 (() => "Hello, " + "JavaScript")() //=> "Hello, JavaScript" (() => Infinity * Infinity )() //=> Infinity
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00197))_

> Yes we can. We can put any expression to the right of the arrow. For example, (() => 0)() is an expression. Can we put it to the right of an arrow, like this: () => (() => 0)() ?
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00198))_

> Yes we can.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00198))_

```
(() => (() => 0)())() //=> 0
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00200))_

> Yes we can!
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00201))_

> When dealing with expressions that have a lot of the same characters (like parentheses), you may find it helpful to format the code to make things stand out.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00202))_

```
(() => (() => 0 )() )() //=> 0
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00203))_

## commas

- The comma operator in JavaScript is interesting. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00206))_
- This is useful when trying to do things that might involve side-effects , but we'll get to that later. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00210))_

```
//=> 2 (1 + 1, 2 + 2)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00207))_

> We can use commas with functions to create functions that evaluate multiple expressions:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00208))_

```
(() => (1 + 1, 2 + 2))() //=> 4
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00209))_

> So we can also write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00210))_

```
() => (1 + 1, 2 + 2)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00211))_

## Or even:

```
() => ( 1 + 1, 2 + 2 )
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00213))_

## the simplest possible block

- It returns the result of evaluating a block that has no statements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00218))_

> There's another thing we can put to the right of an arrow, a block .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00215))_

```
() => {}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00217))_

```
(() => {})() //=> undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00219))_

## undefined

- In JavaScript, the absence of a value is written undefined , and it means there is no value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00222))_
- It will crop up again. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00222))_
- In JavaScript, the absence of a value is written undefined , and it means there is no value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00222))_
- No matter how you evaluate undefined , you get an identical value back. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00227))_
- You might think that undefined in JavaScript is equivalent to NULL in SQL. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00229))_
- In JavaScript, every undefined is identical to every other undefined . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00229))_

```
undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00223))_

```
//=> undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00224))_

> Like numbers, booleans and strings, JavaScript can print out the value undefined .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00225))_

```
undefined === undefined //=> true (() => {})() === (() => {})() //=> true (() => {})() === undefined //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00226))_

> This works because JavaScript has a feature that can infer where the semi-colons should be most of the time.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00228))_

> In SQL, two things that are NULL are not equal to nor share the same identity, because two unknowns can't be equal.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00229))_

## void

- The first form works but it's cumbersome. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00237))_
- The second form works most of the time, but it is possible to break it by reassigning undefined to a different value, something we'll discuss in Reassignment and Mutation. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00237))_

```
void 0 //=> undefined void 1 //=> undefined void (2 + 2) //=> undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00235))_

> void is an operator that takes any value and evaluates to undefined , always.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00236))_

> The third form is guaranteed to always work, so that's what we will use.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00237))_

## back on the block

- 19 Experienced JavaScript programmers are aware that there's a fourth way, using a function argument. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00240))_
- This was actually the preferred mechanism until void became commonplace. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00240))_
- 20 As an exercise for the reader, we suggest you ask your friendly neighbourhood programming language designer or human factors subjectmatter expert to explain why a keyword called void is used to generate an undefined value, instead of calling them both void or both undefined . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00241))_
- We haven't discussed these statements . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00245))_
- Although they aren't very practical, these are valid JavaScript functions, and they return undefined when applied: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00246))_
- There are many kinds of JavaScript statements, but the first kind is one we've already met. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00246))_
- But no matter how we arrange them, a block with one or more expressions still evaluates to undefined : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00250))_
- Some programmers argue that since it's part of the language's definition, it's fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00253))_
- This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00253))_
- Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semicolon insertion. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00253))_
- Basically, there's a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in should you leave them out. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00253))_

```
(() => {})() //=> undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00242))_

```
() => { 2 + 2 } () => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00247))_

> As we saw with commas above, we can rearrange these functions onto multiple lines when we feel its more readable that way:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00248))_

```
() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00249))_

```
(() => { 2 + 2 })() //=> undefined (() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })() //=> undefined (() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })() //=> undefined
```

## functions that evaluate to functions

- It's a function that when applied, evaluates to a function that when applied, evaluates to 0 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00268))_
- So we have a function, that returns a function, that returns zero . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00268))_
- We've been very clever, but so far this all seems very abstract. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00275))_

> If an expression that evaluates to a function is, well, an expression, and if a return statement can have any expression on its right side… Can we put an expression that evaluates to a function on the right side of a function expression?

## Ah. I'd Like to Have an Argument, Please. 22

- Up to now, we've looked at functions without arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00277))_
- Most programmers are perfectly familiar with arguments (often called 'parameters'). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00278))_
- So you know what they are, and I know that you know what they are, but please be patient with the explanation! _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00278))_
- This function has one argument, room , and an empty body. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00281))_
- I'm sure you are perfectly comfortable with the idea that this function has two arguments, room , and board . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00283))_
- I read that aloud as 'When applied to a value representing the diameter, this function returns the diameter times 3.14159265.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00285))_
- To apply a function with an argument (or arguments), we put the argument (or arguments) within the parentheses, like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00286))_
- You won't be surprised to see how to write and apply a function to two arguments: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00288))_

## a quick summary of functions and bodies

- One of the important possible statements is a return statement. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00294))_

> How arguments are used in a body's expression is probably perfectly obvious to you from the examples, especially if you've used any programming language (except for the dialect of BASIC-which I recall from my secondary school-that didn't allow parameters when you called a procedure).
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00292))_

> Expressions consist either of representations of values (like 3.14159265 , true , and undefined ), operators that combine expressions (like 3 + 2 ), some special forms like [1, 2, 3] for creating arrays out of expressions, or function ( arguments ) { body-statements } for creating functions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00293))_

> This loose definition is recursive, so we can intuit (or use our experience with other languages) that since a function can contain a return statement with an expression, we can write a function that returns a function, or an array that contains another array expression.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00295))_

## call by value

- That means that when you write some code that appears to apply a function to an expression or expressions, JavaScript evaluates all of those expressions and applies the functions to the resulting value(s). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00297))_
- That means that when you write some code that appears to apply a function to an expression or expressions, JavaScript evaluates all of those expressions and applies the functions to the resulting value(s). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00297))_

```
((diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265)(1 + 1) //=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00300))_

> What happened internally is that the expression 1 + 1 was evaluated first, resulting in 2 . Then our circumference function was applied to 2 . 24
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00301))_

> We'll see below that while JavaScript always calls by value, the notion of a 'value' has additional subtlety.

## variables and bindings

- Besides a desire to use long words to sound impressive, this is not going to seem attractive until we find ourselves wanting to discuss the role of the Church of England in 19th century British politics. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00306))_
- It has a certain important meaning in its own right, and it's also an excellent excuse to learn about functions that make functions, environments, variables, and more. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00307))_
- But there's another reason for learning the word antidisestablishmentarianism : We might learn how prefixes and postfixes work in English grammar. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00307))_
- The second x , the one in => x , is not an argument, it's an expression referring to a variable . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00308))_
- Every time a function is invoked ('invoked' means 'applied to zero or more arguments'), a new environment is created. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00309))_
- Every time a function is invoked ('invoked' means 'applied to zero or more arguments'), a new environment is created. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00309))_
- This has interesting applications, and they will be explored much more thoroughly in Functions That Are Applied to Functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00310))_
- You can apply a function to one or more functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00310))_
- Well for arguments, that is very simple. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00311))_
- When you apply the function to the arguments, an entry is placed in the dictionary for each argument. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00311))_
- - The value '2' is bound to the name 'x' in the environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00320))_
- - The expression 'x' (the right side of the function) is evaluated within the environment we just created. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00321))_
- - The expression 'x' (the right side of the function) is evaluated within the environment we just created. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00321))_
- - The value of a variable when evaluated in an environment is the value bound to the variable's name in that environment, which is '2' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00322))_
- meaning, that the environment is a dictionary, and that the value 2 is bound to the name x , and that there might be other stuff in that dictionary we aren't discussing right now. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00324))_

> Right now everything looks simple and straightforward, and we can move on to talk about arguments in more detail.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00304))_

```
(x) => (y) => x
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00305))_

> In order to talk about how this works, we should agree on a few terms (you may already know them, but let's check-in together and 'synchronize our dictionaries').
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00308))_

> 24 We said that you can't apply a function to an expression.

```

## call by sharing

- At that time, we looked at how JavaScript distinguishes objects that are identical from objects that are not. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00326))_
- Now it is time to take another look at the distinction between value and reference types. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00326))_
- Earlier, we distinguished JavaScript's value types from its reference types . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00326))_
- So JavaScript can make as many copies of strings, numbers, or booleans as it wishes. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00328))_
- We said that JavaScript binds names to values, but we didn't say what it means to bind a name to a value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00328))_
- As you recall, value types like strings and numbers are identical to each other if they have the same content. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00328))_
- We said that JavaScript binds names to values, but we didn't say what it means to bind a name to a value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00328))_
- JavaScript places references to reference types in environments, and when the value needs to be used, JavaScript uses the reference to obtain the original. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00330))_
- JavaScript does not place copies of reference values in any environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00330))_
- Call by sharing is generally understood to be a specialization of call by value, and it explains why some values are known as value types and other values are known as reference types. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00331))_

> There is a property that JavaScript strictly maintains: When a value-any value-is passed as an argument to a function, the value bound in the function's environment must be identical to the original.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00327))_

> Now we can elaborate: When JavaScript binds a value-type to a name, it makes a copy of the value and places the copy in the environment.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00328))_

> Because many references can share the same value, and because JavaScript passes references as arguments, JavaScript can be said to implement 'call by sharing' semantics.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00331))_

> When we combine our knowledge of value types, reference types, arguments, and closures, we'll understand why this function always evaluates to true no matter what argument 26 you apply it to:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00332))_

```
(value) => ((ref1, ref2) => ref1 === ref2)(value, value)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00333))_

> 26 Unless the argument is NaN , which isn't equal to anything, including itself .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00334))_

## Closures and Scope

- It makes sense that the result value is a function, because the expression for (x) => ... _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00340))_
- It makes sense that the result value is a function, because the expression for (x) => ... _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00340))_
- So now we have a value representing that function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00342))_

```
((x) => (y) => x)(1)(2) //=> 1
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00337))_

```
((x) => (y) => x)(1) //=> [Function]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00339))_

```
(y) => x
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00341))_

```
((y) => x)(2)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00343))_

> There is no x in its environment, it must come from somewhere else.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00344))_

> This, by the way, is one of the great defining characteristics of JavaScript and languages in the same family: Whether they allow things like functions to nest inside each other, and if so, how they handle variables from 'outside' of a function that are referenced inside a function. For example, here's the equivalent code in Ruby:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00345))_

```
lambda { |x| lambda { |y| x } }[1][2] #=> 1
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00346))_

## if functions without free variables are pure, are closures impure?

- 27 A free variable is one that is not bound within the function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00349))_
- Since the function (y) => x doesn't have an argument named x , the variable x isn't bound in this function, which makes it 'free.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00349))_
- It contains a free variable , x . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00349))_
- 27 A free variable is one that is not bound within the function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00349))_
- - Functions containing no free variables are called pure functions . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00351))_
- - Functions containing one or more free variables are called closures . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00352))_
- Pure functions are easiest to understand. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00353))_
- , and it doesn't have a free variable: The only variable anywhere in its body is x , which is certainly bound within (x) => ... _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- The third one is actually two functions, one inside the other. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- The first function doesn't have any variables, therefore doesn't have any free variables. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- The third one is actually two functions, one inside the other. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- has a free variable, but the entire expression refers to (x) => ... _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- The first function doesn't have any variables, therefore doesn't have any free variables. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- , and it doesn't have a free variable: The only variable anywhere in its body is x , which is certainly bound within (x) => ... _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- If you can't, give your reasoning for why it's impossible. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00356))_
- Using only what we've learned so far, attempt to compose a closure that contains a pure function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00356))_
- Using only what we've learned so far, attempt to compose a closure that contains a pure function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00356))_
- If I present to you this pure function (x, y) => x + y , we know exactly what it does with (2, 2) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00357))_
- We can't say what it will do with argument (2) without understanding the magic for evaluating the free variable x . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00357))_

> Up to now, we've only seen one way to 'bind' a variable, namely by passing in an argument with the same name.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00349))_

> Now that we know that variables used in a function are either bound or free, we can bifurcate functions into those with free variables and those without:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00350))_

> They always mean the same thing wherever you use them.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00353))_

> The second doesn't have any free variables, because its only variable is bound.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_

> From this, we learn something: A pure function can contain a closure.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00355))_

> If pure functions can contain closures, can a closure contain a pure function?
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00356))_

> Pure functions always mean the same thing because all of their 'inputs' are fully defined by their arguments.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00357))_

> 27 You may also hear the term 'non-local variable.' Both are correct.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00358))_

## it's always the environment

- As we've said before, all functions are associated with an environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00360))_
- We also hand-waved something when describing our environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00360))_
- To understand how closures are evaluated, we need to revisit environments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00360))_
- As we've said before, all functions are associated with an environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00360))_
- The other big difference is that you can call it with (1) and get a function back that you can later call with (2)(3) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00370))_
- The first function is the result of currying a the second function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00371))_
- Some programming languages automatically curry and partially evaluate functions without the need to manually nest them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00371))_

> So whenever a function is applied to arguments, its environment always has a reference to its parent environment.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00361))_

> And now you can guess how we evaluate ((y) => x)(2) in the environment {y: 2, '..': {x: 1, ...}} .

## shadowy variables from a shadowy planet

- The function (x, y) => x + y is a pure function, because its x is defined within its own environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00378))_
- Although its parent also defines an x , it is ignored when evaluating x + y . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00378))_
- The function (x, y) => x + y is a pure function, because its x is defined within its own environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00378))_
- The x in the great-great-grandparent scope is ignored, as are both w s. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00380))_
- When evaluating x + y + z , JavaScript will find x and y in the great-grandparent scope and z in the parent scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00380))_
- When a variable has the same name as an ancestor environment's binding, it is said to shadow the ancestor. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00380))_
- This is often a good thing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00381))_

## That Constant Coffee Craving

- This feels very different from programming in most other languages, where the focus is on naming functions, methods, and procedures. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00390))_
- Up to now, all we've really seen are anonymous functions , functions that don't have a name. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00390))_
- Naming things is a critical part of programming, but all we've seen so far is how to name arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00390))_
- In order to bind 3.14159265 to the name PI , we'll need a function with a parameter of PI applied to an argument of 3.14159265 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00393))_
- This expression, when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00397))_
- All of our 'functions' are expressions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00397))_
- That sounds bad, but when we think about it, (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265 is also an expression, that when evaluated, returns a function that calculates circumferences. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00397))_
- This one has a few more moving parts, that's all. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00397))_

> There are other ways to name things in JavaScript, but before we learn some of those, let's see how to use what we already have to name things.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00391))_

> There are other ways to name things in JavaScript, but before we learn some of those, let's see how to use what we already have to name things. Let's revisit a very simple example:

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00392))_

> But we can use it just like (diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265 .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00397))_

```
((diameter) => diameter * 3.14159265)(2) //=> 6.2831853 ((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265)(2) //=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00400))_

> We can bind anything we want in an expression by wrapping it in a function that is immediately invoked with the value we want to bind.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00401))_

## inside-out

- A 'magic literal' like 3.14159265 is anathema to sustainable software development. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00407))_
- Well, the first one seems simplest, but a half-century of experience has taught us that names matter. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00407))_
- The third one is easiest for most people to read. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00408))_
- 29 JavaScript programmers regularly use the idea of writing an expression that denotes a function and then immediately applying it to arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00409))_
- Explaining the pattern, Ben Alman coined the term [Immediately Invoked Function Expression][iife] for it, often abbreviated 'IIFE.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00409))_
- 29 JavaScript programmers regularly use the idea of writing an expression that denotes a function and then immediately applying it to arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00409))_
- Everything else is encapsulated in its body. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00411))_
- Well, the wrinkle with this is that typically, invoking functions is considerably more expensive than evaluating expressions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00415))_
- What would be very nice is if the language gave us a way to bind names inside of blocks without incurring the cost of a function invocation. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00418))_

> But then we've obfuscated our code, and we don't want to do that unless we absolutely have to.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00417))_

## const

- Another way to write our 'circumference' function would be to pass PI along with the diameter argument, something like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00420))_
- We have one binding in the environment representing our regular argument, and another our 'constant.' That's more efficient, and it's almost what we wanted all along: A way to bind 3.14159265 to a readable name. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00424))_
- JavaScript gives us a way to do that, the const keyword. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00425))_
- That's much better than what we were writing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00427))_
- We use the const keyword in a const statement . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00428))_
- This underscores what we've said: if we have an expression that evaluates to a function, we apply it with () . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00437))_
- A name that's bound to a function is a valid expression evaluating to a function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00437))_
- 30 We're into the second chapter and we've finally named a function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00441))_

```
(diameter, PI) => diameter * PI
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00421))_

```
((diameter, PI) => diameter * PI)(2, 3.14159265) //=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00423))_

> This differs from our example above in that there is only one environment, rather than two.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00424))_

> We'll learn a lot more about const in future chapters, but here's the most important thing we can do with const :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00425))_

```
(diameter) => { const PI = 3.14159265; return diameter * PI }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00426))_

> const statements occur inside blocks, we can't use them when we write a fat arrow that has an expression as its body.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00428))_

```
((diameter) => ((PI) =>
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00430))_

```
diameter * PI)(3.14159265))(2) Or: ((diameter, PI) => diameter * PI)(2, 3.14159265)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00431))_

```
//=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00432))_

```
((diameter) => { const PI = 3.14159265; return diameter * PI })(2) //=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00434))_

> We can bind any expression.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00435))_

```
(d) => { const calc = (diameter) => { const PI = 3.14159265; return diameter * PI }; return "The circumference is " + calc(d) }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00436))_

> Amazing how such an important idea-naming functions-can be explained en passant in just a few words.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00438))_

```
(d) => { const PI = 3.14159265, calc = (diameter) => diameter * PI; return "The circumference is " + calc(d) }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00440))_

## nested blocks

- One of the places you can find blocks is in an if statement. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00443))_
- But there are other kinds of blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00443))_
- The if statement is a statement, not an expression (an unfortunate design choice), and its clauses are statements or blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00447))_
- We've used a block as the else clause, and since it's a block, we've placed a const statement inside it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00451))_
- We've used a block as the else clause, and since it's a block, we've placed a const statement inside it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00451))_

> Up to now, we've only ever seen blocks we use as the body of functions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00443))_

```
(n) => { const even = (x) => { if (x === 0) return true ; else return !even(x - 1); } return even(n) }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00444))_

```
((n) => { const even = (x) => { if (x === 0) return true ; else return !even(x - 1); } return even(n) })(13) //=> false
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00446))_

```
(n) => { const even = (x) => { if (x === 0) return true ; else { const odd = (y) => !even(y); return odd(x - 1); }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00448))_

```
} return even(n) } And this also works: ((n) => { const even = (x) => { if (x === 0) return true ; else { const odd = (y) => !even(y); return odd(x - 1); } } return even(n) })(42)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00449))_

```
//=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00450))_

## const and lexical scope

- This seems very straightforward, but alas, there are some semantics of binding names that we need to understand if we're to place const anywhere we like. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00453))_
- We know this from the chapter on closures, but even though PI is not bound when we invoke diameter_fn by evaluating diameter_fn(2) , PI is bound when we evaluated (diameter) => diameter * PI , and thus the expression diameter * PI is able to access values for PI and diameter when we evaluate diameter_fn . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00459))_
- We know this from the chapter on closures, but even though PI is not bound when we invoke diameter_fn by evaluating diameter_fn(2) , PI is bound when we evaluated (diameter) => diameter * PI , and thus the expression diameter * PI is able to access values for PI and diameter when we evaluate diameter_fn . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00459))_
- We can see that PI is bound in an environment surrounding (diameter) => diameter * PI , we don't need to know where diameter_fn is invoked. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00460))_
- Although we have bound 3 to PI in the environment surrounding diameter_fn(2) , the value that counts is 3.14159265 , the value we bound to PI in the environment surrounding (diameter) ⇒ diameter * PI. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00463))_
- Binding values to names with const works just like binding values to names with parameter invocations, it uses lexical scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00467))_

```
((diameter_fn) => // ... )( ((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) )
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00456))_

> We can use any expression in there, and that expression can invoke diameter_fn .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00457))_

> It's more than a bit convoluted, but it binds ((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI)(3.14159265) to diameter_fn and evaluates the expression that we've elided. We can use any expression in there, and that expression can invoke diameter_fn . For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00457))_

```
((diameter_fn) => diameter_fn(2) )( ((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) ) //=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00458))_

> This is called lexical scoping 31 , because we can discover where a name is bound by looking at the source code for the program.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00460))_

> We can test this by deliberately creating a 'conflict:'
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00461))_

```
((diameter_fn) => ((PI) => diameter_fn(2) )(3) )( ((PI) => (diameter) => diameter * PI )(3.14159265) ) //=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00462))_

> That much we can carefully work out from the way closures work.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00464))_

```
((diameter_fn) => { const PI = 3; return diameter_fn(2) })( (() => { const PI = 3.14159265; return (diameter) => diameter * PI })() ) //=> 6.2831853
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00466))_

## are consts also from a shadowy planet?

- We just saw that values bound with const use lexical scope, just like values bound with parameters. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00469))_
- Parameters are declared when we create functions, so it makes sense that parameters are bound to environments created when we invoke functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00469))_
- They are looked up in the environment where they are declared. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00469))_
- But instead of binding two different variables to the same name in two different places, we'll bind two different values to the same name, but one environment will be completely enclosed by the other. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00471))_
- This is a book, you've already scanned ahead, so you know that the answer is no , the inner binding does not overwrite the outer binding: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00480))_
- Now we bind 3 to PI in an otherwise empty IIFE inside of our IIFE that binds 3.14159265 to PI . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00480))_
- It has effect inside its own scope, but does not affect the binding in the enclosing scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00482))_
- It has effect inside its own scope, but does not affect the binding in the enclosing scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00482))_
- We say that when we bind a variable using a parameter inside another binding, the inner binding shadows the outer binding. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00482))_
- We'll need a gratuitous block. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00486))_
- But const statements can appear inside blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00486))_
- But const statements can appear inside blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00486))_
- Typically, we want to bind our names as close to where we need them as possible. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00494))_
- This design rule is called the Principle of Least Privilege 32 , and it has both quality and security implications. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00494))_

## rebinding

- JavaScript does not permit us to rebind a name that has been bound with const . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00501))_

> For example, we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00496))_

> By default, JavaScript permits us to rebind new values to names bound with a parameter. For example, we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00496))_

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00499))_

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00501))_

> This is valuable, as it greatly simplifies the analysis of programs to see at a glance that when something is bound with const , we need never worry that its value may change.

## Naming Functions

```
const repeat = (str) => str + str
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00505))_

> It doesn't name the function 'repeat' for the same reason that const answer = 42 doesn't name the number 42 . This syntax binds an anonymous function to a name in an environment, but the function itself remains anonymous.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00506))_

## the function keyword

- JavaScript does have a syntax for naming a function, we use the function keyword. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00508))_
- Until ECMAScript 2015 was created, function was the usual syntax for writing functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00508))_
- - Something else we're about to discuss is optional. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00515))_
- - We have arguments in parentheses, just like fat arrow functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00516))_
- - We do not have a fat arrow, we go directly to the body. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00517))_
- This means that if we want our functions to return a value, we always need to use the return keyword _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00518))_
- This means that if we want our functions to return a value, we always need to use the return keyword _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00518))_
- While the name of the function is a property of the function, not of the environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00528))_
- In this expression, double is the name in the environment, but repeat is the function's actual name. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00528))_
- 33 'Yes of course?' Well, in chapter of a book dedicated to naming functions, it is not surprising that feature we mention has something to do with naming functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00532))_
- Now, the function's actual name has no effect on the environment in which it is used. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00534))_
- So 'actualName' isn't bound in the environment where we use the named function expression. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00536))_
- Here's a function that determines whether a positive integer is even or not. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00536))_
- Clearly, the name even is bound to the function within the function's body . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00538))_
- Clearly, the name even is bound to the function within the function's body . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00538))_
- even is bound within the function itself, but not outside it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00540))_
- This is useful for making recursive functions as we see above, and it speaks to the principle of least privilege: If you don't need to name it anywhere else, you needn't. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00540))_
- even is bound within the function itself, but not outside it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00540))_

```

> Confusingly, the name of the function is not exactly the same thing as the name we may choose to bind to the value of the function.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00526))_

> Placing a name between the function keyword and the argument list names the function. Confusingly, the name of the function is not exactly the same thing as the name we may choose to bind to the value of the function. For example, we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00526))_

```
const double = function repeat (str) { return str + str; }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00527))_

> That may seem confusing, but think of the binding names as properties of the environment, not of the function.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00528))_

```
double .name //=> 'repeat'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00530))_

> In this book we are not examining JavaScript's tooling such as debuggers baked into browsers, but we will note that when you are navigating call stacks in all modern tools, the function's binding name is ignored but its actual name is displayed, so naming functions is very useful even if they don't get a formal binding, e.g.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00531))_

```
someBackboneView.on('click', function clickHandler () { //... });
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00533))_

```
const bindingName = function actualName () { //... }; bindingName //=> [Function: actualName] actualName //=> ReferenceError: actualName is not defined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00535))_

> We'll use it in an IIFE so that we don't have to bind it to a name with const :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00536))_

```
( function even (n) { if (n === 0) { return true } else return !even(n - 1) })(5) //=> false ( function even (n) { if (n === 0) { return true } else return !even(n - 1) })(2) //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00537))_

```
even //=> Can't find variable: even
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00539))_

## function declarations

- There is another syntax for naming and/or defining a function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00542))_
- In that it binds a name in the environment to a named function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00545))_
- However, there are two important differences. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00545))_
- First, function declarations are hoisted to the top of the function in which they occur. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00545))_
- We haven't actually bound a function to the name fizzbuzz before we try to use it, so we get an error. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00548))_
- We haven't actually bound a function to the name fizzbuzz before we try to use it, so we get an error. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00548))_
- The definition of the fizzbuzz is 'hoisted' to the top of its enclosing scope (an IIFE in this case). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00551))_
- This behaviour is intentional on the part of JavaScript's design to facilitate a certain style of programming where you put the main logic up front, and the 'helper functions' at the bottom. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00551))_
- It is not necessary to declare functions in this way in JavaScript, but understanding the syntax and its behaviour (especially the way it differs from const ) is essential for working with production code. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00551))_

> It's called a function declaration statement , and it looks a lot like a named function expression, only we use it as a statement:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00542))_

```
function someName () { // ... } This behaves a little like: const someName = function someName () // ... }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00543))_

```
{
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00544))_

> Consider this example where we try to use the variable fizzbuzz as a function before we bind a function to it with const :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00546))_

```
( function () { return fizzbuzz(); const fizzbuzz = function fizzbuzz () { return "Fizz" + "Buzz"; } })() //=> undefined is not a function (evaluating 'fizzbuzz()')
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00547))_

```
( function () { return fizzbuzz(); function fizzbuzz () { return "Fizz" + "Buzz"; } })() //=> 'FizzBuzz' Although fizzbuzz is declared later in the function, JavaScript behaves as if we'd written: ( function () { {
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00549))_

```
const fizzbuzz = function fizzbuzz () return "Fizz" + "Buzz"; } return fizzbuzz(); })()
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00550))_

## function declaration caveats 34

- Although some JavaScript environments permit the following code, this example is technically illegal and definitely a bad idea: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00553))_
- 34 A number of the caveats discussed here were described in Jyrly Zaytsev's excellent article Named function expressions demystified. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00554))_
- Or it may work one way today and a different way when the JavaScript engine is updated, say with a new optimization. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00556))_
- Function declarations are not supposed to occur inside of blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00556))_
- Function declarations are not supposed to occur inside of blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00556))_
- The parentheses make this an expression, not a function declaration. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00559))_

> Function declarations are formally only supposed to be made at what we might call the 'top level' of a function.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00553))_

```
( function (camelCase) { return fizzbuzz(); if (camelCase) { function fizzbuzz () { return "Fizz" + "Buzz"; } } else { function fizzbuzz () { return "Fizz" + "Buzz"; } } })( true ) //=> 'FizzBuzz'? Or ERROR: Can't find variable: fizzbuzz?
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00555))_

> The big trouble with expressions like this is that they may work just fine in your test environment but work a different way in production.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00556))_

> Another caveat is that a function declaration cannot exist inside of any expression, otherwise it's a function expression.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00557))_

```
function trueDat () { return true } But this is not: ( function trueDat () { return true })
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00558))_

## Combinators and Function Decorators

## higher-order functions

- Generally speaking, a function that either takes functions as arguments, or returns a function, or both, is referred to as a 'higher-order' function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00562))_
- But before we go on, we'll talk about some specific types of higher-order functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00565))_

> JavaScript functions are values, so JavaScript functions can take functions as arguments, return functions, or both.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00562))_

```
const repeat = (num, fn) => (num > 0) ? (repeat(num - 1, fn), fn(num)) : undefined repeat(3, function (n) { console.log(`Hello ${ n } `) }) //=> 'Hello 1' 'Hello 2' 'Hello 3' undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00564))_

## combinators

- We'd learn that the fundamental combinators are named after birds following the example of Raymond Smullyan's famous book To Mock a Mockingbird 36 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00569))_
- If we were learning Combinatorial Logic, we'd start with the most basic combinators like S , K , and I , and work up from there to practical combinators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00569))_
- We'd learn that the fundamental combinators are named after birds following the example of Raymond Smullyan's famous book To Mock a Mockingbird 36 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00569))_
- We won't be strict about using only previously defined combinators in their construction. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00572))_
- We won't be strict about using only previously defined combinators in their construction. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00572))_
- This is, of course, just one example of many. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00575))_

> 'A combinator is a higher-order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments.'-Wikipedia 35
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00568))_

> 36 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1P096Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00A1P096Y& linkCode=as2&tag=raganwald001-20
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00571))_

> In this book, we will be using a looser definition of 'combinator:' Higher-order pure functions that take only functions as arguments and return a function.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00572))_

```
const compose = (a, b) => (c) => a(b(c)) Let's say we have: const addOne = (number) => number + 1; const doubleOf = (number) => number * 2; With compose , anywhere you would write const doubleOfAddOne = (number) => doubleOf(addOne(number)); You could also write: const doubleOfAddOne = compose(doubleOf, addOne);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00574))_

> While some programmers believe 'There Should Only Be One Way To Do It,' having combinators available as well as explicitly writing things out with lots of symbols and keywords has some advantages when used judiciously.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00575))_

## a balanced statement about combinators

- Code that uses a lot of combinators tends to name the verbs and adverbs (like doubleOf , addOne , and compose ) while avoiding language keywords and the names of nouns (like number ). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00577))_
- So one perspective is that combinators are useful when you want to emphasize what you're doing and how it fits together, and more explicit code is useful when you want to emphasize what you're working with. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00577))_

## function decorators

- A function decorator is a higher-order function that takes one function as an argument, returns another function, and the returned function is a variation of the argument function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00579))_
- 37 As we'll discuss later, this implementation of the B Combinator is correct in languages like Scheme, but for truly general-purpose use in JavaScript, it needs to correctly manage the function context. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00580))_
- 38 We'll see later why an even more useful version would be written (fn) => (...args) => !fn(...args) _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00581))_
- Function decorators aren't strict about being pure functions, so there's more latitude for making decorators than combinators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00589))_
- not is a function decorator because it modifies a function while remaining strongly related to the original function's semantics. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00589))_
- not is a function decorator because it modifies a function while remaining strongly related to the original function's semantics. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00589))_

```
const not = (fn) => (x) => !fn(x)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00582))_

> So instead of writing !someFunction(42) , we can write not(someFunction)(42) .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00583))_

```
const something = (x) => x != null ;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00584))_

```
const nothing = (x) => !something(x);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00586))_

```
const nothing = not(something);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00588))_

## Building Blocks

- The weakness is that you will. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00591))_
- There are ifs, fors, returns, everything thrown higgledy piggledy together. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00591))_
- Although you needn't restrict yourself to a small number of simple patterns, it can be helpful to understand the patterns so that you can structure your code around some basic building blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00591))_
- When you look at functions within functions in JavaScript, there's a bit of a 'spaghetti code' look to it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00591))_

> The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00591))_

## composition

- It's really that simple: Whenever you are chaining two or more functions together, you're composing them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00595))_
- The other 80% comes from organizing your code such that you can use it: Writing functions that can be composed in various ways. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00597))_
- If that was all there was to it, composition wouldn't matter much. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00597))_
- Once is useful for ensuring that certain side effects are not repeated. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00598))_
- We'll also look at maybe: It ensures that a function does nothing if it is given nothing (like null or undefined ) as an argument. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00598))_
- But once and maybe compose, so you can chain them together as you see fit: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00599))_

```
const cookAndEat = (food) => eat(cook(food));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00594))_

> You can compose them with explicit JavaScript code as we've just done.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00595))_

```
const compose = (a, b) => (c) => a(b(c)); const cookAndEat = compose(eat, cook);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00596))_

> But like many patterns, using it when it applies is only 20% of the benefit.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00597))_

> In the recipes, we'll look at a decorator called once: It ensures that a function can only be executed once.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00598))_

> Of course, you needn't use combinators to implement either of these ideas, you can use if statements.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00599))_

```
const actuallyTransfer= (from, to, amount) => // do something const invokeTransfer = once(maybe(actuallyTransfer(...)));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00600))_

## partial application

- In that case, we can't get the final value, but we can get a function that represents part of our application. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00602))_
- Another basic building block is partial application . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00602))_
- The Underscore 39 library provides a higher-order function called map . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00603))_
- Code is easier than words for this. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00603))_
- mapWith takes any function as an argument and returns a partially applied map function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00608))_
- The resulting functionsquareAll -is still the map function, it's just that we've applied one of its two arguments already. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00608))_
- The important thing to see is that partial application is orthogonal to composition, and that they both work together nicely: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00610))_
- 40 Modern JavaScript implementations provide a map method for arrays, but Underscore's implementation also works with older browsers if you are working with that headache. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00613))_
- Partial application also has a combinator, which we'll see in the partial recipe. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00616))_

> But what if we only supply some of the arguments?
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00602))_

```
_.map([1, 2, 3], (n) => n * n) //=> [1, 4, 9]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00604))_

> , so we can use it by writing: 41

```
const squareAll = (array) => map(array, (n) => n * n);
```

> 41 If we don't want to sort out Underscore, we can also write the following: const map = (a, fn) => a.map(fn); , and trust that it works even though we haven't discussed methods yet.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00612))_

> 41 If we don't want to sort out Underscore, we can also write the following: const map = (a, fn) => a.map(fn); , and trust that it works even though we haven't discussed methods yet.

```
const safeSquareAll = mapWith(maybe((n) => n * n));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00614))_

```
safeSquareAll([1, null , 2, 3]) //=> [1, null, 4, 9]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00615))_

## Magic Names

- When a function is applied to arguments (or 'called'), JavaScript binds the values of arguments to the function's argument names in an environment created for the function's execution. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00618))_
- What we haven't discussed so far is that JavaScript also binds values to some 'magic' names in addition to any you put in the argument list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00618))_

## the function keyword

- There are two separate rules for these 'magic' names, one for when you invoke a function using the function keyword, and another for functions defined with 'fat arrows.' We'll begin with how things work for functions defined with the function keyword. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00620))_
- The second magic name is very interesting, it's called arguments , and the most interesting thing about it is that it contains a list of arguments passed to a function: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00621))_
- The first magic name is this , and it is bound to something called the function's context. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00621))_
- It is wise to treat them as read-only at all times. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00626))_
- It is wise to treat them as read-only at all times. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00626))_
- We'll see it used in many of the recipes, starting off with partial application and ellipses. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00631))_

```
const plus = function (a, b) { return arguments[0] + arguments[1]; } plus(2,3) //=> 5

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00622))_

```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00624))_

> arguments always contains all of the arguments passed to a function, regardless of how many are declared.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00625))_

> 42 You should never attempt to define your own bindings against 'magic' names that JavaScript binds for you.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00626))_

```
const plus = function () { return arguments[0] + arguments[1]; } plus(2,3) //=> 5
```

> The most common use of the arguments binding is to build functions that can take a variable number of arguments.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00631))_

## magic names and fat arrows

- But if we use a fat arrow, arguments will be defined in the outer environment, the one defined with function . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00636))_
- To give a contrived example, this function takes a number and returns an array representing a row in a hypothetical multiplication table. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00639))_
- It uses mapWith , which we discussed in Building Blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00639))_
- Our 'fat arrow' function (column) => column * arguments[0] doesn't bind arguments when it's invoked. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00641))_
- This works just fine, because arguments[0] refers to the 3 we passed to the function row . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00641))_
- This works just fine, because arguments[0] refers to the 3 we passed to the function row . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00641))_
- But for the purposes of discussing ideas, we can use the same name twice in two different contexts. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00642))_
- 44 Yes, we also used the name mapWith for working with ordinary collections elsewhere. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00642))_
- It's the same idea, after all. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00642))_
- Sometimes, a function is meant to be used as a Big-F function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00645))_
- Although this example is clearly unrealistic, there is a general design principle that deserves attention. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00645))_
- In our example above, row is a Big-F function, but (column) => column * arguments[0] is a small-f function, it exists just to give mapWith something to apply. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00646))_
- It's a simple representation of an expression to be computed. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00646))_

> The magic names this and arguments have a different behaviour when you invoke a function that was defined with a fat arrow: Instead of being bound when the function is invoked, the fat arrow function always acquires the bindings for this and arguments from its enclosing scope, just like any other binding.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00633))_

> For example, when this expression's inner function is defined with function , arguments[0] refers to its only argument, "inner" :

```
( function () { return (() => arguments[0])('inner'); })('outer') //=> "outer"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00637))_

> Although it seems quixotic for the two syntaxes to have different semantics, it makes sense when you consider the design goal: Fat arrow functions are designed to be very lightweight and are often used with constructs like mapping or callbacks to emulate syntax.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00638))_

```
const row = function () { return mapWith( (column) => column * arguments[0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] ) } row(3) //=> [3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00640))_

> If we were writing a library of functions, we would have to disambiguate the two kinds of mapping functions with special names, namespaces, or modules.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00642))_

```
const row = function () { return mapWith( function (column) { return column * arguments[0] }, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] ) } row(3) //=> [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00643))_

> Having magic variables apply to Big-F functions but not to small-G functions makes it much easier to use small-F functions as syntax, treating them as expressions or blocks that can be passed to functions like mapWith .

## Summary

## Functions

- - Functions are reference values . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00651))_
- - Functions are applied to arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00652))_
- - Fat arrow functions have expressions or blocks as their bodies. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00654))_
- - Function bodies have zero or more statements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00656))_
- - Block bodies evaluate to whatever is returned with the return keyword, or to undefined . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00658))_
- - JavaScript uses const to bind values to names within block scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00659))_
- - JavaScript uses const to bind values to names within block scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00659))_
- - JavaScript uses function declarations to bind functions to names within function scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00660))_
- - JavaScript uses function declarations to bind functions to names within function scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00660))_
- - Blocks also create scopes if const statements are within them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00662))_
- - Blocks also create scopes if const statements are within them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00662))_
- - Scopes are nested and free variable references closed over. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00663))_

> - Functions are values that can be part of expressions, returned from other functions, and so forth.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00650))_

> - function keyword functions always have blocks as their bodies.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00655))_

## Recipes with Basic Functions

- Before combining ingredients, begin with implements so clean, they gleam. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00666))_
- Before combining ingredients, begin with implements so clean, they gleam. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00666))_
- Having looked at basic pure functions and closures, we're going to see some practical recipes that focus on the premise of functions that return functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00667))_

## Disclaimer

- The overall use of each recipe will fit within the spirit of the language discussed so far, even if the implementations may not. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00669))_
- The overall use of each recipe will fit within the spirit of the language discussed so far, even if the implementations may not. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00669))_

> The recipes are written for practicality, and their implementation may introduce JavaScript features that haven't been discussed in the text to this point, such as methods and/or prototypes.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00669))_

## Partial Application

- In Building Blocks, we discussed partial application, but we didn't write a generalized recipe for it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00671))_
- This is such a common tool that many libraries provide some form of partial application. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00671))_
- These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00672))_
- 48 If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a 'hole' in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00672))_
- As noted above, our partial recipe allows us to create functions that are partial applications of functions that are context aware. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00674))_
- We'd need a different recipe if we wish to create partial applications of object methods. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00674))_

```
const callFirst = (fn, larg) => function (...rest) { return fn.call( this , larg, ...rest); } const callLast = (fn, rarg) => function (...rest) { return fn.call( this , ...rest, rarg); } const greet = (me, you) => `Hello, ${ you } , my name is ${ me } `; const heliosSaysHello = callFirst(greet, 'Helios'); heliosSaysHello('Eartha') //=> 'Hello, Eartha, my name is Helios' const sayHelloToCeline = callLast(greet, 'Celine'); sayHelloToCeline('Eartha') //=> 'Hello, Celine, my name is Eartha'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00673))_

> We take it a step further, and can use gathering and spreading to allow for partial application with more than one argument:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00677))_

```
const callLeft = (fn, ...args) => (...remainingArgs) => fn(...args, ...remainingArgs); const callRight = (fn, ...args) => (...remainingArgs) => fn(...remainingArgs, ...args);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00678))_

## Unary

- JavaScript has a .map method for arrays, and many libraries offer a map function with the same semantics. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00681))_
- The most common use case is to fix a problem. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00681))_
- And when you call parseInt with map , the index is interpreted as a radix. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00688))_
- This doesn't work because parseInt is defined as parseInt(string[, radix]) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00688))_
- This doesn't work because parseInt is defined as parseInt(string[, radix]) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00688))_
- Wecould write ['1', '2', '3'].map((s) => parseInt(s)) , or we could come up with a decorator to do the job for us: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00689))_

```
['1', '2', '3'].map(parseFloat) //=> [1, 2, 3]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00682))_

```
[1, 2, 3].map( function (element, index, arr) { console.log({element: element, index: index, arr: arr}) }) //=> { element: 1, index: 0, arr: [ 1, 2, 3 ] } // { element: 2, index: 1, arr: [ 1, 2, 3 ] } // { element: 3, index: 2, arr: [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00685))_

> If you pass in a function taking only one argument, it simply ignores the additional arguments. But some functions have optional second or even third arguments. For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00686))_

> If you pass in a function taking only one argument, it simply ignores the additional arguments.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00686))_

```
['1', '2', '3'].map(parseInt) //=> [1, NaN, NaN]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00687))_

> What we want is to convert parseInt into a function taking only one argument.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00688))_

```
const unary = (fn) => fn.length === 1 ? fn : function (something) { return fn.call( this , something) }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00690))_

> And now we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00691))_

```
['1', '2', '3'].map(unary(parseInt)) //=> [1, 2, 3]
```

## Tap

- It has some surprising applications. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00697))_
- One is when you want to do something with a value for sideeffects, but keep the value around. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00697))_
- tap is a traditional name borrowed from various Unix shell commands. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00699))_

```
const K = (x) => (y) => x;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00696))_

```
const tap = (value) => (fn) => ( typeof (fn) === 'function' && fn(value), value )
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00698))_

> It takes a value and returns a function that always returns the value, but if you pass it a function, it executes the function for side-effects.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00699))_

```
const tap = (value, fn) => { const curried = (fn) => ( typeof (fn) === 'function' && fn(value), value ); return fn === undefined ? curried : curried(fn); } Now we can write: tap('espresso')((it) => { console.log(`Our drink is ' ${ it } '`) }); //=> Our drink is 'espresso' 'espresso' Or: tap('espresso', (it) => { console.log(`Our drink is ' ${ it } '`) }); //=> Our drink is 'espresso' 'espresso'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00703))_

> And if we wish it to do nothing at all, We can write either tap('espresso')() or tap('espresso', null)
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00704))_

> tap can do more than just act as a debugging aid.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00705))_

## Maybe

- A common problem in programming is checking for null or undefined (hereafter called 'nothing,' while all other values including 0 , [] and false will be called 'something'). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00707))_
- Naturally, there's a function decorator recipe for that, borrowed from Haskell's maybe monad 50 , Ruby's andand 51 , and CoffeeScript's existential method invocation: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00712))_
- If some code ever tries to call model.setSomething with nothing, the operation will be skipped. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00721))_

> Languages like JavaScript do not strongly enforce the notion that a particular variable or particular property be something, so programs are often written to account for values that may be nothing.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00707))_

```
const isSomething = (value) => value !== null && value !== void 0; const checksForSomething = (value) => { if (isSomething(value)) { // function's true logic } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00709))_

> Alternately, the function may be intended to work with any value, but the code calling the function wishes to emulate the behaviour of doing nothing by design when given nothing:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00710))_

```
var something = isSomething(value) ? doesntCheckForSomething(value) : value;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00711))_

```
const maybe = (fn) => function (...args) { if (args.length === 0) { return } else { for ( let arg of args) { if (arg == null ) return ; }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00713))_

```
return fn.apply( this , args) } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00716))_

```
maybe((a, b, c) => a + b + c)(1, 2, 3) //=> 6 maybe((a, b, c) => a + b + c)(1, null , 3) //=> undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00718))_

```
function Model () {}; Model.prototype.setSomething = maybe( function (value) { this .something = value; });
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00720))_

## Once

- once is an extremely helpful combinator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00723))_
- That function will call your function once, and thereafter will return undefined whenever it is called. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00725))_
- That function will call your function once, and thereafter will return undefined whenever it is called. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00725))_
- (Note: There are some subtleties with decorators like once that involve the intersection of state with methods. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00728))_

> It ensures that a function can only be called, well, once .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00723))_

```
const once = (fn) => { let done = false ; return function () { return done ? void 0 : ((done = true ), fn.apply( this , arguments)) } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00724))_

```
const askedOnBlindDate = once( () => "sure, why not?" ); askedOnBlindDate() //=> 'sure, why not?' askedOnBlindDate() //=> undefined askedOnBlindDate() //=> undefined
```

## Left-Variadic Functions

> 52 In JavaScript, you can make a variadic function by gathering parameters.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00730))_

> A variadic function is a function that is designed to accept a variable number of arguments. 52 In JavaScript, you can make a variadic function by gathering parameters. For example:

function team2(...players, captain, coach) { console.log(` ${ captain } (captain)`); for ( let player of players) { console.log(player); } console.log(`squad coached by ${ coach } `); } //=> Unexpected token
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00735))_

> ECMAScript 2015 only permits gathering parameters from the end of the parameter list.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00736))_

## a history lesson

- In 'Ye Olde Days,' 53 JavaScript could not gather parameters, and we had to either do backflips with arguments and .slice , or we wrote ourselves a variadic decorator that could gather arguments into the last declared parameter. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00738))_
- This is a right-variadic function , meaning that it has one or more fixed arguments, and the rest are gathered into the rightmost argument. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00744))_

```
var __slice = Array.prototype.slice; function rightVariadic (fn) { if (fn.length < 1) return fn; return function () { var ordinaryArgs = (1 <= arguments.length ? __slice.call(arguments, 0, fn.length - 1) : []), restOfTheArgsList = __slice.call(arguments, fn.length - 1), args = (fn.length <= arguments.length ? ordinaryArgs.concat([restOfTheArgsList]) : []); return fn.apply( this , args); } }; var firstAndButFirst = rightVariadic( function test (first, butFirst) { return [first, butFirst] }); firstAndButFirst('why', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid') //=> ["why",["hello","there","little","droid"]]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00739))_

```
var firstAndButFirst = rightVariadic( function test (first, butFirst) { return [first, butFirst] }); We now simply write: const firstAndButFirst = (first, ...butFirst) [first, butFirst];
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00742))_

```
=>
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00743))_

## overcoming limitations

- All left-variadic functions have one or more fixed arguments, and the rest are gathered into the leftmost argument. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00748))_
- Our leftVariadic function is a decorator that turns any function into a function that gathers parameters from the left , instead of from the right. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00752))_

> But as noted above, we can't write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00746))_

```
const butLastAndLast = (...butLast, last) => [butLast, last];
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00747))_

> We sure can, by using the techniques from rightVariadic .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00749))_

```
const leftVariadic = (fn) => { if (fn.length < 1) { return fn; } else { return function (...args) { const gathered = args.slice(0, args.length - fn.length + 1), spread = args.slice(args.length - fn.length + 1); return fn.apply( this , [gathered].concat(spread)
```

```

## left-variadic destructuring

> Gathering arguments for functions is one of the ways JavaScript can destructure arrays.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00754))_

```
const [first, ...butFirst] = ['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid']; first //=> 'why' butFirst //=> ["hello","there","little","droid"]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00755))_

> As with parameters, we can't gather values from the left when destructuring an array:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00756))_

```
const [...butLast, last] = ['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid']; //=> Unexpected token
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00757))_

```
const [butLast, last] = leftVariadic((butLast, last) => [butLast, last])(...['wh\ y', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid']); butLast //=> ['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little'] last //=> 'droid'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00759))_

> But we can write our own left-gathering function utility using the same principles without all the tedium:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00760))_

```
const leftGather = (outputArrayLength) => { return function (inputArray) { return [inputArray.slice(0, inputArray.length - outputArrayLength + 1)].conc\ at( inputArray.slice(inputArray.length - outputArrayLength + 1) ) } }; const [butLast, last] = leftGather(2)(['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little', 'droid\ ']); butLast //=> ['why', 'hello', 'there', 'little'] last //=> 'droid'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00761))_

> With leftGather , we have to supply the length of the array we wish to use as the result, and it gathers excess arguments into it from the left, just like leftVariadic gathers excess parameters for a function.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00762))_

## Picking the Bean: Choice and Truthiness

- In addition to numbers, we often need to represent a much more basic idea of truth or falsehood. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00765))_

## true

## false

- All values of true are === all other values of true. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00771))_
- true and false are value types. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00771))_
- Now, note well: We have said what happens if you pass boolean values to ! _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00775))_

> We can see that is the case by looking at some operators we can perform on boolean values, !
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00771))_

```
! true //=> false ! false //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00772))_

```
false && false //=> false false && true //=> false true && false //=> false true && true //=> true false || false //=> false false || true //=> true true || false //=> true true || true //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00774))_

## truthiness and the ternary operator

- In JavaScript, there is a notion of 'truthiness.' Every value is either 'truthy' or 'falsy.' Obviously, false is falsy. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00777))_
- 54 And there are more: 0 is falsy, a value representing 'none of something.' The empty string, '' is falsy, a value representing having no characters. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00777))_
- So are null and undefined , values that semantically represent 'no value.' NaN is falsy, a value representing the result of a calculation that is not a number. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00777))_
- The reason why truthiness matters is that the various logical operators (as well as the if statement) actually operate on truthiness , not on boolean values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00779))_
- It evaluates first , and if first is 'truthy', it evaluates second and that is its value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00780))_
- If first is not truthy, it evaluates third and that is its value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00780))_
- JavaScript inherited an operator from the C family of languages, the ternary operator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00780))_
- It also doesn't introduce braces, and that can be a help or a hindrance if we want to introduce a new scope or use statements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00782))_

> Every other value in JavaScript is 'truthy' except the aforementioned false , null , undefined , NaN , 0 , and '' .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00778))_

> Every other value in JavaScript is 'truthy' except the aforementioned false , null , undefined , NaN , 0 , and '' . (Many other languages that have a notion of truthiness consider zero and the empty string to be truthy, not falsy, so beware of blindly transliterating code from one language to another!)
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00778))_

> It's the only operator that takes three arguments.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00780))_

> This is a lot like the if statement, however it is an expression , not a statement, and that can be very valuable.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00782))_

```
true ? 'Hello' : 'Good bye' //=> 'Hello' 0 ? 'Hello' : 'Good bye' //=> 'Good bye' [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].length === 5 ? 'Pentatonic' : 'Quasimodal' //=> 'Pentatonic'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00784))_

> The fact that either the second or the third (but not both) expressions are evaluated can have important repercussions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00785))_

> The fact that either the second or the third (but not both) expressions are evaluated can have important repercussions. Consider this hypothetical example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00785))_

```
const status = isAuthorized(currentUser) ? deleteRecord(currentRecord) : 'Forbid\ den';
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00786))_

> Wecertainly don't want JavaScript trying to evaluate deleteRecord(currentRecord) unless isAuthorized(currentUser) returns true .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00787))_

## truthiness and operators

- , && , and || are a little more subtle than our examples above implied. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00789))_
- So in JavaScript (and other languages with similar semantics), when you see something like !!currentUser() , this is an idiom that means 'true if currentUser is truthy.' Thus, a function like currentUser() is free to return null , or undefined , or false if there is no current user. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00791))_
- So in JavaScript (and other languages with similar semantics), when you see something like !!currentUser() , this is an idiom that means 'true if currentUser is truthy.' Thus, a function like currentUser() is free to return null , or undefined , or false if there is no current user. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00791))_
- , && and || do not necessarily evaluate to true or false . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00793))_
- If we look at our examples above, we see that when we pass true and false to && and || , we do indeed get true or false as a result. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00800))_
- This is not a subtle distinction. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00803))_

> It always returns false if its argument is truthy, and true is its argument is not truthy:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00789))_

```
!5 //=> false ! undefined //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00790))_

> Programmers often take advantage of this behaviour to observe that !!(someExpression) will always evaluate to true is someExpression is truthy, and to false if it is not.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00791))_

```
1 || 2 //=> 1 null && undefined //=> null undefined && null //=> undefined
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00801))_

> They don't operate strictly on logical values, and they don't commute: a || b is not always equal to b || a , and the same goes for && .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00802))_

## || and && are control-flow operators

- This is more than just an optimization. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00811))_

> We've seen the ternary operator: It is a control-flow operator, not a logical operator. The same is true of && and || . Consider this tail-recursive function that determines whether a positive integer is even:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00805))_

> For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00806))_

```
const even = (n) => n === 0 || (n !== 1 && even(n - 2)) even(42) //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00807))_

> The expression on the left is always evaluated, and its value determines whether the expression on the right is evaluated or not.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00811))_

## function parameters are eager

- This leads to the infinite recursion we fear. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00815))_

> In contrast to the behaviour of the ternary operator, || , and && , function parameters are always eagerly evaluated :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00813))_

```
const or = (a, b) => a || b const and = (a, b) => a && b const even = (n) => or(n === 0, and(n !== 1, even(n - 2))) even(42) //=> Maximum call stack size exceeded.
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00814))_

> Nowourexpression or(n === 0, and(n !== 1, even(n - 2))) is calling functions, and JavaScript always evaluates the expressions for parameters before passing the values to a function to invoke.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00815))_

> If we need to have functions with control-flow semantics, we can pass anonymous functions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00816))_

```
const or = (a, b) => a() || b() const and = (a, b) => a() && b() const even = (n) => or(() => n === 0, () => and(() => n !== 1, () => even(n - 2))) even(7) //=> false
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00817))_

> Here we've passed functions that contain the expressions we want to evaluate, and now we can write our own functions that can delay evaluation.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00818))_

## summary

- - Logical operators are based on truthiness and falsiness, not the strict values true and false . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00820))_
- - Function invocation uses eager evaluation, so if we need to roll our own control-flow semantics, we pass it functions, not expressions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00823))_

> is a logical operator, it always returns true or false .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00821))_

> - The ternary operator ( ?: ), || , and && are control flow operators, they do not always return true or false , and they have short-cut semantics.

## Composing and Decomposing Data

- Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time.-Alan Perlis, Epigrams in Programming 55 _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00826))_

## Arrays and Destructuring Arguments

- Arrays are JavaScript's 'native' representation of lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00829))_
- Lists are important because they represent ordered collections of things, and ordered collections are a fundamental abstraction for making sense of reality. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00829))_
- While we have mentioned arrays briefly, we haven't had a close look at them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00829))_
- Strings are important because they represent writing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00829))_
- Strings are important because they represent writing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00829))_
- Lists are important because they represent ordered collections of things, and ordered collections are a fundamental abstraction for making sense of reality. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00829))_

## array literals

- JavaScript has a literal syntax for creating an array: The [ and ] characters. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00831))_
- This is an array with one element that is an array with one element that is an array with one element that is an array with one element that is an empty array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00839))_
- Although that seems like something nobody would ever construct, many students have worked with almost the exact same thing when they explored various means of constructing arithmetic from Set Theory. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00839))_
- Although that seems like something nobody would ever construct, many students have worked with almost the exact same thing when they explored various means of constructing arithmetic from Set Theory. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00839))_
- Array literals are expressions, and arrays are reference types . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00842))_

> We can create an empty array:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00831))_

```
[] //=> []
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00832))_

> We can create an array with one or more elements by placing them between the brackets and separating the items with commas.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00833))_

```
[1] //=> [1] [2, 3, 4] //=> [2,3,4]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00834))_

```
[ 2, 3, 2 + 2 ] //=> [2,3,4]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00836))_

```
[[[[[]]]]]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00838))_

```
const wrap = (something) => [something]; wrap("lunch") //=> ["lunch"]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00841))_

> We can see that each time an array literal is evaluated, we get a new, distinct array, even if it contains the exact same elements:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00842))_

```
[] === [] //=> false [2 + 2] === [2 + 2] //=> false const array_of_one = () => [1]; array_of_one() === array_of_one() //=> false
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00843))_

## element references

- We know that every array is its own unique entity, with its own unique reference. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00848))_

> Array elements can be extracted using [ and ] as postfix operators.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00845))_

```
const oneTwoThree = ["one", "two", "three"]; oneTwoThree[0] //=> 'one' oneTwoThree[1] //=> 'two' oneTwoThree[2] //=> 'three'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00846))_

> As we can see, JavaScript Arrays are zero-based 56 .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00847))_

```
const x = [], a = [x]; a[0] === x //=> true, arrays store references to the things you put in them.
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00850))_

## destructuring arrays

- There is another way to extract elements from arrays: Destructuring , a feature going back to Common Lisp, if not before. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00852))_
- There is another way to extract elements from arrays: Destructuring , a feature going back to Common Lisp, if not before. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00852))_
- We could do the same thing with (name) => name[1] , but destructuring is code that resembles the data it consumes, a valuable coding style. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00860))_

```
const wrap = (something) => [something]; Let's expand it to use a block and an extra name: wrapped = [something];
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00853))_

```
const wrap = (something) => { const return wrapped; } wrap("package") //=> ["package"]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00854))_

> The line const wrapped = [something]; is interesting. On the left hand is a name to be bound, and on the right hand is an array literal, a template for constructing an array, very much like a quasi-literal string.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00855))_

> In JavaScript, we can actually reverse the statement and place the template on the left and a value on the right:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00856))_

```
const unwrap = (wrapped) => { const [something] = wrapped; return something; } unwrap(["present"]) //=> "present"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00857))_

> We can do the same thing with more than one element:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00858))_

> The statement const [something] = wrapped; destructures the array represented by wrapped , binding the value of its single element to the name something . We can do the same thing with more than one element:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00858))_

```
const surname = (name) => { const [first, last] = name; return last; } surname(["Reginald", "Braithwaite"]) //=> "Braithwaite"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00859))_

> Destructuring can nest:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00861))_

```
const description = (nameAndOccupation) => { const [[first, last], occupation] = nameAndOccupation; return ` ${ first } is a ${ occupation } `; } description([["Reginald", "Braithwaite"], "programmer"]) //=> "Reginald is a programmer"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00862))_

## gathering

- Sometimes we need to extract arrays from arrays. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00864))_
- Here is the most common pattern: Extracting the head and gathering everything but the head from an array: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00864))_
- to place the elements of an array inside another array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00872))_

```
const [car, ...cdr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; car //=> 1 cdr //=> [2, 3, 4, 5]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00865))_

> car and cdr 57 are archaic terms that go back to an implementation of Lisp running on the IBM 704 computer. Some other languages call them first and butFirst , or head and tail . We will use a common convention and call variables we gather rest , but refer to the ... operation as a 'gather,' following Kyle Simpson's example. 58
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00866))_

> Alas, the ... notation does not provide a universal patten-matching capability. For example, we cannot write
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00867))_

> For example, we cannot write
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00867))_

```
const [...butLast, last] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; //=> ERROR const [first, ..., last] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; //=> ERROR Now, when we introduced destructuring, we saw that it is kind-of-sort-of the reverse of array literals. So if const wrapped = [something]; Then: const [unwrapped] = something; What is the reverse of gathering? We know that: const [car, ...cdr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; What is the reverse? It would be: const cons = [car, ...cdr]; oneTwoThree = ["one", "two", "three"];
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00870))_

```
Let's try it: const ["zero", ...oneTwoThree] //=> ["zero","one","two","three"]

## destructuring is not pattern matching

- If it does, assignments are made where appropriate. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00874))_
- But this is not how JavaScript works. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00877))_
- JavaScript tries its best to assign things, and if there isn't something that fits, JavaScript binds undefined to the name. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00877))_
- That match would fail because the array doesn't have an element to assign to what . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00877))_
- That match would fail because the array doesn't have an element to assign to what . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00877))_
- From its very inception, JavaScript has striven to avoid catastrophic errors. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00881))_
- This often means that we must write our own code to detect failure conditions, as we cannot reply on the language to point out when we are doing semantically meaningless things. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00881))_

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00880))_

> As a result, it often coerces values, passes undefined around, or does whatever it can to keep executing without failing.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00881))_

## destructuring and return values

> Some languages support multiple return values: A function can return several things at once, like a value and an error code.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00883))_

```
const description = (nameAndOccupation) => { if (nameAndOccupation.length < 2) { return ["", "occupation missing"] } else { const [[first, last], occupation] = nameAndOccupation; return [` ${ first } is a ${ occupation } `, "ok"]; } } const [reg, status] = description([["Reginald", "Braithwaite"], "programmer"]); reg //=> "Reginald is a programmer" status //=> "ok"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00884))_

## destructuring parameters

- This is very useful indeed, and we'll see more of it in a moment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00892))_
- 59 Gathering in parameters has a long history, and the usual terms are to call gathering 'pattern matching' and to call a name that is bound to gathered values a 'rest parameter.' The term 'rest' is perfectly compatible with gather: 'Rest' is the noun, and 'gather' is the verb. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00893))_

> Consider the way we pass arguments to parameters:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00886))_

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00887))_

## Self-Similarity

- Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time.-Alan Perlis, Epigrams in Programming 60 _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00895))_
- In Arrays and Destructuring Arguments, we worked with the basic idea that putting an array together with a literal array expression was the reverse or opposite of taking it apart with a destructuring assignment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00896))_
- We saw that the basic idea that putting an array together with a literal array expression was the reverse or opposite of taking it apart with a destructuring assignment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00897))_
- Some are empty, some have three items, some forty-two, some contain numbers, some contain strings, some a mixture of elements, there are all kinds of lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00898))_
- - Consists of an element concatenated with a list . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00901))_
- The first rule is simple: [] is a list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00902))_
- Given an element e and a list list , [e, ...list] is a list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00902))_
- We know that we can get the length of an array using its .length . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00909))_
- 61 Well, actually, this does not work for arrays that contain undefined as a value, but we are not going to see that in our examples. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00910))_
- Well, the length of first is 1 , there's just one element at the front. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00913))_
- If an array is not empty, and we break it into two pieces, first and rest , the length of our array is going to be length(first) + length(rest) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00913))_
- We need something for when the array isn't empty. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00913))_
- This makes sense because our definition of a list is recursive, and if a list is self-similar, it is natural to create an algorithm that is also self-similar. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00916))_
- Our length function is recursive , it calls itself. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00916))_

> Some data structures, like lists, can obviously be seen as a collection of items.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00898))_

> But we can also define a list by describing a rule for building lists.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00899))_

> We can express that using a spread.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00902))_

```
[] //=> [] ["baz", ...[]] //=> ["baz"] ["bar", ...["baz"]] //=> ["bar","baz"] ["foo", ...["bar", "baz"]] //=> ["foo","bar","baz"]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00903))_

> Thanks to the parallel between array literals + spreads with destructuring + rests, we can also use the same rules to decompose lists:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00904))_

```
const [first, ...rest] = []; first //=> undefined rest //=> []: const [first, ...rest] = ["foo"]; first //=> "foo" rest //=> [] const [first, ...rest] = ["foo", "bar"]; first //=> "foo" rest //=> ["bar"] const [first, ...rest] = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]; first //=> "foo" rest //=> ["bar","baz"] For the purpose of this exploration, we will presume the following: const isEmpty = ([first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00907))_

```
isEmpty([]) //=> true isEmpty([0]) //=> false isEmpty([[]]) //=> false
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00908))_

> Armed with our definition of an empty list and with what we've already learned, we can build a great many functions that operate on arrays.

## linear recursion

- When promising students are trying to choose between pure mathematics and applied engineering, they are given a two-part aptitude test. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00919))_
- In the first part, they are led to a laboratory bench and told to follow the instructions printed on the card. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00919))_
- After a bit the water boils, and they turn off the burner and are lead to a second bench. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00920))_
- Of course, all the students know what to do: They fill the beaker with water, place the stand on the burner and the beaker on the stand, then they turn the burner on and use the sparker to ignite the flame. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00920))_
- Of course, all the students know what to do: They fill the beaker with water, place the stand on the burner and the beaker on the stand, then they turn the burner on and use the sparker to ignite the flame. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00920))_
- After a bit the water boils, and they turn off the burner and are lead to a second bench. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00920))_
- Whereas the mathematicians take the beaker off the stand and empty it, thus reducing the situation to a problem they have already solved. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00921))_
- Once again, there is a card that reads, 'boil water.' But this time, the beaker is on the stand over the burner, as left behind by the previous student. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00921))_
- Whereas the mathematicians take the beaker off the stand and empty it, thus reducing the situation to a problem they have already solved. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00921))_
- There is more to recursive solutions that simply functions that invoke themselves. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00922))_
- - When all small problems have been solved, compose the solutions into one big solution _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00926))_
- The big elements of divide and conquer are a method for decomposing a problem into smaller problems, a test for the smallest possible problem, and a means of putting the pieces back together. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00927))_
- The big elements of divide and conquer are a method for decomposing a problem into smaller problems, a test for the smallest possible problem, and a means of putting the pieces back together. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00927))_
- We need a test for the terminal case. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00929))_
- Whereas if an element is an array, we'll flatten it and put it together with the rest of our solution. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00931))_
- The usual 'terminal case' will be that flattening an empty array will produce an empty array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00931))_
- Whereas if an element is an array, we'll flatten it and put it together with the rest of our solution. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00931))_
- 62 flatten is a very simple unfold, a function that takes a seed value and turns it into an array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00933))_
- Once again, the solution directly displays the important elements: Dividing a problem into subproblems, detecting terminal cases, solving the terminal cases, and composing a solution from the solved portions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00935))_

> Our solutions are a little simpler in that we don't really break a problem down into multiple pieces, we break a piece off the problem that may or may not be solvable, and solve that before sticking it onto a solution for the rest of the problem.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00927))_

> This simpler form of 'divide and conquer' is called linear recursion . It's very useful and simple to understand. Let's take another example. Sometimes we want to flatten an array, that is, an array of arrays needs to be turned into one array of elements that aren't arrays. 62
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00928))_

```
Array.isArray("foo") //=> false Array.isArray(["foo"]) //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00930))_

> The next terminal case is that if an element isn't an array, we don't flatten it, and can put it together with the rest of our solution directly.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00931))_

> Unfolds can be thought of a 'path' through a data structure, and flattening a tree is equivalent to a depth-first traverse.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00933))_

```
const flatten = ([first, ...rest]) => { if (first === undefined ) { return []; } else if (!Array.isArray(first)) { return [first, ...flatten(rest)]; } else { return [...flatten(first), ...flatten(rest)]; } } flatten(["foo", [3, 4, []]]) //=> ["foo",3,4]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00934))_

## mapping

- Another common problem is applying a function to every element of an array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00937))_
- This specific case of linear recursion is called 'mapping,' and it is not necessary to constantly write out the same pattern again and again. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00942))_

```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00939))_

```
const truthyAll = ([first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ? [] : [!!first, ...truthyAll(rest)]; truthyAll([ null , true , 25, false , "foo"]) //=> [false,true,true,false,true]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00941))_

> Functions can take functions as arguments, so let's 'extract' the thing to do to each element and separate it from the business of taking an array apart, doing the thing, and putting the array back together.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00942))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, array) => // ...
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00944))_

> Even in this small function, we can identify the terminal condition, the piece being broken off, and recomposing the solution.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00945))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, [first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ? [] : [fn(first), ...mapWith(fn, rest)]; mapWith((x) => x * x, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> [1,4,9,16,25] mapWith((x) => !!x, [ null , true , 25, false , "foo"]) //=> [false,true,true,false,true]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00946))_

## folding

- Our foldWith function is a generalization of our mapWith function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00957))_

```
const sumSquares = ([first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ? 0 : first * first + sumSquares(rest); sumSquares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> 55
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00949))_

> Let's rewrite mapWith so that we can use it to sum squares.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00953))_

```
const foldWith = (fn, terminalValue, [first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ? terminalValue : fn(first, foldWith(fn, terminalValue, rest));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00954))_

```
foldWith((number, rest) => number * number + rest, 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> 55
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00956))_

> We can represent a map as a fold, we just need to supply the array rebuilding code:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00957))_

```
const squareAll = (array) => foldWith((first, rest) => [first * first, ...rest],\ [], array); squareAll([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> [1,4,9,16,25]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00958))_

> And if we like, we can write mapWith using foldWith :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00959))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, array) => foldWith((first, rest) => [fn(first), ...rest], [\ ], array), squareAll = (array) => mapWith((x) => x * x, array); squareAll([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> [1,4,9,16,25]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00960))_

> And to return to our first example, our version of length can be written as a fold:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00961))_

```
const length = (array) => foldWith((first, rest) => 1 + rest, 0, array); length([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> 5
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00962))_

## summary

- Linear recursion is a basic building block of algorithms. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00964))_
- And finally, while folding is a special case of linear recursion, mapping is a special case of folding. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00964))_
- Its basic form parallels the way linear data structures like lists are constructed: This helps make it understandable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00964))_

> Its specialized cases of mapping and folding are especially useful and can be used to build other functions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00964))_

## Tail Calls (and Default Arguments)

- The mapWith and foldWith functions we wrote in Self-Similarity are useful for illustrating the basic principles behind using recursion to work with self-similar data structures, but they are not 'production-ready' implementations. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00966))_
- One of the reasons they are not production-ready is that they consume memory proportional to the size of the array being folded. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00966))_
- first is not undefined , so it evaluates [fn(first), …mapWith(fn, rest)]. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00969))_
- To do that, it has to evaluate fn(first) and mapWith(fn, rest) , then evaluate [fn(first), ...mapWith(fn, rest)] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00969))_
- First, mapWith((x) => x * x, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is invoked. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00969))_
- To do that, it has to evaluate fn(first) and mapWith(fn, rest) , then evaluate [fn(first), ...mapWith(fn, rest)] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00969))_
- So we know that JavaScript is going to hang on to 1 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00972))_
- JavaScript cannot throw first away. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00972))_
- And the same thing happens: JavaScript has to hang on to 2 (or 4 , or both, depending on the implementation), plus some housekeeping information so it remembers what to do with that value, while it calls the equivalent of mapWith((x) => x * x, [3, 4, 5]) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00973))_
- Next, JavaScript invokes mapWith(fn, rest) , which is semantically equivalent to mapWith((x) => x * x, [2, 3, 4, 5]) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00973))_
- That information is saved on a call stack , and it is quite expensive. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00975))_
- In fact, there are several better ways. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00978))_
- Making algorithms faster is a very highly studied field of computer science. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00978))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, [first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ? [] : [fn(first), ...mapWith(fn, rest)]; mapWith((x) => x * x, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> [1,4,9,16,25]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00968))_

```
const mapWith = function (fn, [first, ...rest]) { if (first === undefined ) { return []; } else { const _temp1 = fn(first), _temp2 = mapWith(fn, rest), _temp3 = [_temp1, ..._temp2]; return _temp3; } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00971))_

> Note that while evaluating mapWith(fn, rest) , JavaScript must retain the value first or fn(first) , plus some housekeeping information so it remembers what to do with mapWith(fn, rest) when it has a result.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00972))_

> It can start assembling the resulting array and start discarding the information it is saving.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00974))_

> Furthermore, doubling the length of an array will double the amount of space we need on the stack, plus double all the work required to set up and tear down the housekeeping data for each call (these are called call frames , and they include the place where the function was called, an environment, and so on).
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00975))_

> In practice, using a method like this with more than about 50 items in an array may cause some implementations to run very slow, run out of memory and freeze, or cause an error.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00976))_

## tail-call optimization

- This is a tail-call, because it invokes another function and returns its result. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00982))_
- But the third is fn.apply(this, args) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00982))_
- It isn't going to do any more work, so it can throw its existing stack frame away. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00982))_
- There are three places it returns. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00982))_
- This is a tail-call, because it invokes another function and returns its result. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00982))_
- And in fact, it does exactly that: It throws the stack frame away, and does not consume extra memory when making a maybe -wrapped call. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00983))_
- This is a very important characteristic of JavaScript: If a function makes a call in tail position, JavaScript optimizes away the function call overhead and stack space. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00983))_
- The length function calls itself, but it is not a tail-call, because it returns 1 + length(rest) , not length(rest) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00986))_
- The length function calls itself, but it is not a tail-call, because it returns 1 + length(rest) , not length(rest) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00986))_

> A'tail-call' occurs when a function's last act is to invoke another function, and then return whatever the other function returns. For example, consider the maybe function decorator:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00980))_

```
const maybe = (fn) => function (...args) { if (args.length === 0) { return ; } else { for ( let arg of args) { if (arg == null ) return ; } return fn.apply( this , args); } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00981))_

> This is interesting, because after sorting out what to supply as arguments ( this , args ), JavaScript can throw away everything in its current stack frame.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00982))_

> That is excellent, but one wrapping is not a big deal. When would we really care? Consider this implementation of length :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00984))_

```
const length = ([first, ...rest]) => first === undefined ? 0 : 1 + length(rest);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00985))_

> The problem can be stated in such a way that the answer is obvious: length does not call itself in tail position, because it has to do two pieces of work, and while one of them is in the recursive call to length , the other happens after the recursive call.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00987))_

## converting non-tail-calls to tail-calls

- The obvious solution is push the 1 + work into the call to length . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00990))_
- This version of length calls uses lengthDelaysWork , and JavaScript optimizes that not to take up memory proportional to the length of the string. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00995))_
- And this basic transformation from a recursive function that does not make a tail call, into a recursive function that calls itself in tail position, is a bread-and-butter pattern for programmers using a language that incorporates tail-call optimization. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00998))_

```
const lengthDelaysWork = ([first, ...rest], numberToBeAdded) => first === undefined ? 0 + numberToBeAdded : lengthDelaysWork(rest, 1 + numberToBeAdded) lengthDelaysWork(["foo", "bar", "baz"], 0) //=> 3
```

```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00993))_

```
Or we could use partial application: const callLast = (fn, ...args) => (...remainingArgs) => fn(...remainingArgs, ...args); const length = callLast(lengthDelaysWork, 0); length(["foo", "bar", "baz"]) //=> 3
```

## factorials

- While this is mathematically elegant, it is computational filigree 63 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01005))_
- Asbefore, we wrote a factorialWithDelayedWork function, then used partial application ( callLast ) to make a factorial function that took just the one argument and supplied the initial work value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01011))_
- Asbefore, we wrote a factorialWithDelayedWork function, then used partial application ( callLast ) to make a factorial function that took just the one argument and supplied the initial work value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01011))_

> In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n , denoted by n! , is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n . For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01001))_

```
5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01002))_

```
const factorial = (n) => n == 1 ? n : n * factorial(n - 1); factorial(1) //=> 1 factorial(5) //=> 120
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01004))_

> Once again, it is not tail-recursive, it needs to save the stack with each invocation so that it can take the result returned and compute n * factorial(n -1) .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01006))_

```
const factorialWithDelayedWork = (n, work) => n === 1 ? work : factorialWithDelayedWork(n - 1, n * work); const factorial = (n) => factorialWithDelayedWork(n, 1);

```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01010))_

## default arguments

- What we really want is this: We want to write something like factorial(6) , and have JavaScript automatically know that we really mean factorial(6, 1) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01016))_
- But when it calls itself, it will call factorial(5, 6) and that will not mean factorial(5, 1) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01016))_
- Now we don't need to use two functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01021))_
- A default argument is concise and readable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01021))_

> Our problem is that we can directly write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01013))_

```
const factorial = (n, work) => n === 1 ? work : factorial(n - 1, n * work); factorial(1, 1) //=> 1 factorial(5, 1) //=> 120
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01014))_

> But it is hideous to have to always add a 1 parameter, we'd be demanding that everyone using the factorial function know that we are using a tail-recursive implementation.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01015))_

```
const factorial = (n, work = 1) => n === 1 ? work : factorial(n - 1, n * work); factorial(1) //=> 1 factorial(6) //=> 720
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01018))_

> By writing our parameter list as (n, work = 1) => , we're stating that if a second parameter is not provided, work is to be bound to 1 . We can do similar things with our other tail-recursive functions:

## defaults and destructuring

> Now we learn that we can create a default parameter argument.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01023))_

```
const [first, second = "two"] = ["one"]; ` ${ first } . ${ second } ` //=> "one . two" const [first, second = "two"] = ["primus", "secundus"]; ` ${ first } . ${ second } ` //=> "primus . secundus"

## Garbage, Garbage Everywhere

- We have now seen how to use Tail Calls to execute mapWith in constant space: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01028))_
- But when we try it on very large arrays, we discover that it is still very slow. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01030))_
- The right tool to discover why it's still slow is a memory profiler, but a simple inspection of the program will reveal the following: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01030))_
- To do that, we take the array in prepend and push fn(first) onto the end, creating a new array that will be passed to the next invocation of mapWith . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01031))_
- The array we had in prepend is no longer used. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01033))_
- In GC environments, it is marked as no longer being used, and eventually the garbage collector recycles the memory it is using. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01033))_
- Lather, rinse, repeat: Ever time we call mapWith , we're creating a new array, copying all the elements from prepend into the new array, and then we no longer use prepend . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01033))_
- Lather, rinse, repeat: Ever time we call mapWith , we're creating a new array, copying all the elements from prepend into the new array, and then we no longer use prepend . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01033))_
- Although the maximum amount of memory does not grow, the thrashing as we create short-lived arrays is very bad, and we do a lot of work copying elements from one array to another. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01034))_
- Key Point : Our [first, ...rest] approach to recursion is slow because that it creates a lot of temporary arrays, and it spends an enormous amount of time copying elements into arrays that end up being discarded. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01035))_

- But this is not how JavaScript's built-in arrays work. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01037))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, [first, ...rest], prepend = []) => first === undefined ? prepend : mapWith(fn, rest, [...prepend, fn(first)]); mapWith((x) => x * x, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> [1,4,9,16,25]
```

> We may not be creating 3,000 stack frames, but we are creating three thousand new arrays and copying elements into each and every one of them.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01034))_

> 64 It needn't always be so: Programmers have developed specialized data structures that make operations like this cheap, often by arranging for structures to share common elements by default, and only making copies when changes are made.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01037))_

## some history

- 66 Lisp was one of the very first high-level languages, the very first implementation was written for the IBM 704 67 computer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01040))_
- (The very first FORTRAN implementation was also written for the 704). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01040))_
- The CPU's instruction set featured two important macros: CAR would fetch 15 bits representing the Contents of the Address part of the Register, while CDR would fetch the Contents of the Decrement part of the Register. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01041))_
- The 704 had a 36-bit word, meaning that it was very fast to store and retrieve 36-bit values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01041))_
- 66 Lisp is still very much alive, and one of the most interesting and exciting programming languages in use today is Clojure, a Lisp dialect that runs on the JVM, along with its sibling ClojureScript, Clojure that transpiles to JavaScript. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01044))_
- In broad terms, this means that a single 36-bit word could store two separate 15-bit values and it was very fast to save and retrieve pairs of values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01045))_
- If you had two 15-bit values and wished to write them to the register, the CONS macro would take the values and write them to a 36-bit word. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01045))_
- In broad terms, this means that a single 36-bit word could store two separate 15-bit values and it was very fast to save and retrieve pairs of values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01045))_
- Lisp's basic data type is often said to be the list, but in actuality it was the 'cons cell,' the term used to describe two 15-bit values stored in one word. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01046))_
- The 15-bit values were used as pointers that could refer to a location in memory, so in effect, a cons cell was a little data structure with two pointers to other cons cells. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01046))_
- Thus, CONS put two values together, CAR extracted one, and CDR extracted the other. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01046))_
- Thus, CONS put two values together, CAR extracted one, and CDR extracted the other. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01046))_
- Lists were represented as linked lists of cons cells, with each cell's head pointing to an element and the tail pointing to another cons cell. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01047))_
- Having these instructions be very fast was important to those early designers: They were working on one of the first high-level languages (COBOL and FORTRAN being the others), and computers in the late 1950s were extremely small and slow by today's standards. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01048))_
- Although the 704 used core memory, it still used vacuum tubes for its logic. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01048))_
- This is a Linked List 68 , it's just that those early Lispers used the names car and cdr after the hardware instructions, whereas today we use words like data and reference . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01056))_
- This is a Linked List 68 , it's just that those early Lispers used the names car and cdr after the hardware instructions, whereas today we use words like data and reference . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01056))_
- car is very fast, it simply extracts the first element of the cons cell. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01058))_
- Getting one reference to a structure that already exists is faster than copying a bunch of elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01061))_
- There's no making copies of arrays, the time to cdr a list with five elements is the same as the time to cdr a list with 5,000 elements, and no temporary arrays are needed. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01061))_
- In Lisp, it's blazingly fast because it happens in hardware. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01061))_
- So now we understand that in Lisp, a lot of things use linked lists, and they do that in part because it was what the hardware made possible. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01062))_
- So now we understand that in Lisp, a lot of things use linked lists, and they do that in part because it was what the hardware made possible. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01062))_
- And so it is today that languages like JavaScript have arrays that are slow to split into the equivalent of a car / cdr pair, but instructional examples of recursive programs still have echoes of their Lisp origins. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01064))_
- We'll look at linked lists again when we look at Plain Old JavaScript Objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01065))_

```
const cons = (a, d) => [a, d], car = ([a, d]) => a, cdr = ([a, d]) => d;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01050))_

> We can make a list by calling cons repeatedly, and terminating it with null :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01051))_

```
const oneToFive = cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, cons(4, cons(5, null )))));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01052))_

```
oneToFive //=> [1,[2,[3,[4,[5,null]]]]]
```

```
const node5 = [5, null ], node4 = [4, node5], node3 = [3, node4], node2 = [2, node3], node1 = [1, node2]; const oneToFive = node1;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01055))_

```
car(oneToFive) //=> 1
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01057))_

```
cdr(oneToFive) //=> [2,[3,[4,[5,null]]]]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01060))_

> In JavaScript, it's still much, much, much faster to get all the elements except the head from a linked list than from an array.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01061))_

> We're doing something laborious and memory-inefficient compared to using a linked list as Lisp did and as we can still do if we choose.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01063))_

> That being said, it is easy to understand and helps us grasp how literals and destructuring works, and how recursive algorithms ought to mirror the self-similarity of the data structures they manipulate.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01064))_

## so why arrays

- But not for iterating over a list: Pointer chasing through memory is quite a bit slower than incrementing an index. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01069))_
- Well, linked lists are fast for a few things, like taking the front element off a list, and taking the remainder of a list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01069))_
- We have avoided discussing rebinding and mutating values, but if we want to change elements of our lists, the naïve linked list implementation suffers as well: When we take the cdr of a linked list, we are sharing the elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01070))_
- If we make any change other than cons-ing a new element to the front, we are changing both the new list and the old list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01070))_
- Arrays avoid this problem by pessimistically copying all the references whenever we extract an element or sequence of elements from them (We'll see this explained later in Mutation). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01071))_
- For these and other reasons, almost all languages today make it possible to use a fast array or vector type that is optimized for iteration, and even Lisp now has a variety of data structures that are optimized for specific use cases. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01072))_

> And if you want an arbitrary item from a list, you have to iterate through the list element by element, whereas with the indexed array you just fetch it.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01069))_

## summary

- But it is an extremely simple illustration of how recursion works when you have a self-similar means of constructing a data structure. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01074))_
- But it is an extremely simple illustration of how recursion works when you have a self-similar means of constructing a data structure. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01074))_

> Although we showed how to use tail calls to map and fold over arrays with [first, ...rest] , in reality this is not how it ought to be done.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01074))_

## Plain Old JavaScript Objects

- Remembering that the name is the first item is error-prone, and being expected to look at user[0][1] and know that we are talking about a surname is unreasonable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01079))_
- Now they could write user[NAME][LAST] or user[OCCUPATION][TITLE] instead of user[0][1] or user[1][0] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01081))_
- Over time, this need to build heterogeneous data structures with access to members by name evolved into the Dictionary 69 data type, a mapping from a unique set of objects to another set of objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01081))_
- JavaScript has dictionaries, and it calls them 'objects.' The word 'object' is loaded in programming circles, due to the widespread use of the term 'object-oriented programming' that was coined by Alan Kay but has since come to mean many, many things to many different people. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01083))_
- In JavaScript, an object is a map from string keys to values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01084))_

> Lists are not the only way to represent collections of things, but they are the 'oldest' data structure in the history of high level languages, because they map very closely to the way the hardware is organized in a computer.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01076))_

```
const remember = ["the milk", "the coffee beans", "the biscotti"]; And they can be used to store heterogeneous things in various levels of structure:
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01077))_

```
const user = [["Reginald", "Braithwaite"],[ "author", ["JavaScript Allongé", "Ja\ vaScript Spessore", "CoffeeScript Ristretto"]]];
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01078))_

> So back when lists were the only things available, programmers would introduce constants to make things easier on themselves:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01079))_

```
const NAME = 0, FIRST = 0, LAST = 1, OCCUPATION = 1, TITLE = 0, RESPONSIBILITIES = 1; const user = [["Reginald", "Braithwaite"],[ "author", ["JavaScript Allongé", "Ja\ vaScript Spessore", "CoffeeScript Ristretto"]]];
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01080))_

> Dictionaries store key-value pairs, so instead of binding NAME to 0 and then storing a name in an array at index 0 , we can bind a name directly to name in a dictionary, and we let JavaScript sort out whether the implementation is a list of key-value pairs, a hashed collection, a tree of some sort, or anything else.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01082))_

## literal object syntax

- JavaScript has a literal syntax for creating objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01087))_
- Two objects created with separate evaluations have differing identities, just like arrays: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01089))_
- Values contained within an object work just like values contained within an array, we access them by reference to the original: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01091))_
- Values contained within an object work just like values contained within an array, we access them by reference to the original: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01091))_
- Names needn't be alphanumeric strings. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01093))_
- If the name is an alphanumeric string conforming to the same rules as names of variables, there's a simplified syntax for accessing the values: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01095))_
- It is very common to associate named function expressions with keys in objects, and there is a 'compact method syntax' for binding named function expressions to keywords: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01105))_
- (There are some other technical differences between binding a named function expression and using compact method syntax, but they are not relevant here. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01107))_

## destructuring objects

- It is very common to write things like title: title when destructuring objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01114))_
- When the label is a valid variable name, it's often the most obvious variable name as well. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01114))_

## revisiting linked lists

- In essence, this simple implementation used functions to create an abstraction with named elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01120))_
- As we saw above, and discussed in Garbage, Garbage Everywhere, it is fast to iterate forward through a linked list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01123))_
- The problem here is that linked lists are constructed back-to-front, but we iterate over them frontto-back. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01125))_
- We could follow the strategy of delaying the work. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01126))_
- We have unwittingly reversed the list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01128))_
- This makes sense, if lists are constructed from back to front, and we make a linked list out of items as we iterate through it, we're going to get a backwards copy of the list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01128))_
- Likewise, it takes twice as much memory, because it constructs a reverse of the desired result before throwing it away. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01130))_
- Likewise, it takes twice as much memory, because it constructs a reverse of the desired result before throwing it away. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01130))_
- Our mapWith function takes twice as long as a straight iteration, because it iterates over the entire list twice, once to map, and once to reverse the list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01130))_
- Mind you, this is still much, much faster than making partial copies of arrays. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01131))_
- Whereas our naïve array algorithm created 2 n superfluous arrays and copied n 2 superfluous values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01131))_
- For a list of length n , wecreated n superfluous nodes and copied n superfluous values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01131))_
- Whereas our naïve array algorithm created 2 n superfluous arrays and copied n 2 superfluous values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01131))_

```
const cons = (a, d) => [a, d], car = ([a, d]) => a, cdr = ([a, d]) => d;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01119))_

> But now that we've looked at objects, we can use an object instead of a two-element array.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01120))_

```
In that case, a linked list of the numbers 1 , 2 , and 3 will look like this: { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY } } } . We can then perform the equivalent of [first, ...rest] with direct property accessors:
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01121))_

```
const EMPTY = {}; const OneTwoThree = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY \ } } }; OneTwoThree.first //=> 1 OneTwoThree.rest //=> {"first":2,"rest":{"first":3,"rest":{}}} OneTwoThree.rest.rest.first //=> 3 Taking the length of a linked list is easy: const length = (node, delayed = 0) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : length(node.rest, delayed + 1); length(OneTwoThree) //=> 3
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01122))_

```
const slowcopy = (node) => node === EMPTY ? EMPTY : { first: node.first, rest: slowcopy(node.rest)}; slowcopy(OneTwoThree) //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":3,"rest":{}}}}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01124))_

> So to copy a list, we have to save all the bits on the call stack and then construct the list from back-to-front as all the recursive calls return.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01125))_

```
const copy2 = (node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : copy2(node.rest, { first: node.first, rest: delayed }); copy2(OneTwoThree) //=> {"first":3,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":1,"rest":{}}}}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01127))_

```
const reverse = (node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : reverse(node.rest, { first: node.first, rest: delayed }); And now, we can make a reversing map: const reverseMapWith = (fn, node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : reverseMapWith(fn, node.rest, { first: fn(node.first), rest: delayed }); reverseMapWith((x) => x * x, OneTwoThree) //=> {"first":9,"rest":{"first":4,"rest":{"first":1,"rest":{}}}} And a regular mapWith follows: const reverse = (node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : reverse(node.rest, { first: node.first, rest: delayed }); const mapWith = (fn, node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? reverse(delayed) : mapWith(fn, node.rest, { first: fn(node.first), rest: delayed }); mapWith((x) => x * x, OneTwoThree) //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":4,"rest":{"first":9,"rest":{}}}}

## Mutation

- Recall that you can access a value from within an array or an object using [] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01134))_
- Specifically, arrays and objects can mutate. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01134))_
- Recall that you can access a value from within an array or an object using [] . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01134))_
- Both halloween and allHallowsEve are bound to the same array value within the local environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01142))_
- Both halloween and allHallowsEve are bound to the same array value within the local environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01142))_
- There are two nested environments, and each one binds a name to the exact same array value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01144))_
- Before we could reassign things, the most important point about this is that the identities were the same, because they were the same value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01144))_
- In each of these examples, we have created two aliases for the same value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01144))_
- Before we could reassign things, the most important point about this is that the identities were the same, because they were the same value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01144))_
- The outer value of allHallowsEve was not changed because all we did was rebind the name halloween within the inner environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01147))_
- The outer value of allHallowsEve was not changed because all we did was rebind the name halloween within the inner environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01147))_
- We haven't rebound the inner name to a different variable, we've mutated the value that both bindings share. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01149))_
- Mutating existing objects has special implications when two bindings are aliases of the same value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01150))_
- JavaScript permits the reassignment of new values to existing bindings, as well as the reassignment and assignment of new values to elements of containers such as arrays and objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01150))_

> In JavaScript, almost every type of value can mutate .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01134))_

```
const oneTwoThree = [1, 2, 3]; oneTwoThree[0] = 'one'; oneTwoThree //=> [ 'one', 2, 3 ]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01135))_

> You can even add a value:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01136))_

```
const oneTwoThree = [1, 2, 3]; oneTwoThree[3] = 'four'; oneTwoThree //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 'four' ]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01137))_

> You can do the same thing with both syntaxes for accessing objects:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01138))_

```
const name = {firstName: 'Leonard', lastName: 'Braithwaite'}; name.middleName = 'Austin' name //=> { firstName: 'Leonard', # lastName: 'Braithwaite', # middleName: 'Austin' }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01139))_

> Wehave established that JavaScript's semantics allow for two different bindings to refer to the same value. For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01140))_

```
const allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31] const halloween = allHallowsEve;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01141))_

```
const allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]; ( function (halloween) { // ... })(allHallowsEve);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01143))_

> This is vital. Consider what we already know about shadowing:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01145))_

```
const allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]; ( function (halloween) { halloween = [2013, 10, 31]; })(allHallowsEve); allHallowsEve //=> [2012, 10, 31]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01146))_

```
const allHallowsEve = [2012, 10, 31]; ( function (halloween) { halloween[0] = 2013; })(allHallowsEve); allHallowsEve //=> [2013, 10, 31]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01148))_

> Note well: Declaring a variable const does not prevent us from mutating its value, only from rebinding its name.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01151))_

## mutation and data structures

- Mutation is a surprisingly complex subject. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01153))_
- It is possible to compute anything without ever mutating an existing entity. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01153))_
- In general, mutation makes some algorithms shorter to write and possibly faster, but harder to reason about. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01153))_
- While we're executing the mapWith function, we're constructing a new linked list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01154))_
- One pattern many people follow is to be liberal with mutation when constructing data, but conservative with mutation when consuming data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01154))_
- By this pattern, we would be happy to use mutation to construct the list while running mapWith . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01154))_
- The gathering operation [a, b, ...ThreeToFive] is slower, but 'safer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01161))_
- We just use the data, and the less we mutate it, the fewer the times we have to think about whether making changes will be 'safe.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01162))_

> But after returning the new list, we then become conservative about mutation. This also makes sense: Linked lists often use structure sharing. For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01155))_

```
const EMPTY = {}; const OneToFive = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: { first: 4, rest: { first: 5, rest: EMPTY } } } } }; OneToFive //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":"fou\ r","rest":{"first":"five","rest":{}}}}}} const ThreeToFive = OneToFive.rest.rest; ThreeToFive //=> {"first":3,"rest":{"first":4,"rest":{"first":5,"rest":{}}}} ThreeToFive.first = "three"; ThreeToFive.rest.first = "four"; ThreeToFive.rest.rest.first = "five"; ThreeToFive //=> {"first":"three","rest":{"first":"four","rest":{"first":"five","rest":{}}\ }} OneToFive //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":"fou\ r","rest":{"first":"five","rest":{}}}}}} Changes made to ThreeToFive affect OneToFive , because they share the same structure. When we wrote ThreeToFive = OneToFive.rest.rest; , we weren't making a brand new copy of {"first":3,"rest":{"fir we were getting a reference to the same chain of nodes. Structure sharing like this is what makes linked lists so fast for taking everything but the first item
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01157))_

```
const OneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; ...ThreeToFive] = OneToFive;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01159))_

```
OneToFive //=> [1,2,3,4,5] const [a, b, ThreeToFive //=> [3, 4, 5] ThreeToFive[0] = "three"; ThreeToFive[1] = "four"; ThreeToFive[2] = "five"; ThreeToFive //=> ["three","four","five"] OneToFive //=> [1,2,3,4,5]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01160))_

> We don't have to remember to use copying operations when we pass it as a value to a function, or extract some data from it.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01162))_

## building with mutation

- Adding a node to an existing list is risky, as we saw when considering the fact that OneToFive and ThreeToFive share the same nodes. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01168))_
- But when we're in the midst of creating a brand new list, we aren't sharing any nodes with any other lists, and we can afford to be more liberal about using mutation to save space and/or time. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01168))_

> Without mutation, a copy of a linked list can be made in constant space by reversing a reverse of the list:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01164))_

> As noted, one pattern is to be more liberal about mutation when building a data structure. Consider our copy algorithm. Without mutation, a copy of a linked list can be made in constant space by reversing a reverse of the list:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01164))_

```
const reverse = (node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : reverse(node.rest, { first: node.first, rest: delayed }); const copy = (node) => reverse(reverse(node));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01165))_

> If we want to make a copy of a linked list without iterating over it twice and making a copy we discard later, we can use mutation:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01166))_

```
const copy = (node, head = null , tail = null ) => { if (node === EMPTY) { return head; } else if (tail === null ) { const { first, rest } = node; const newNode = { first, rest }; return copy(rest, newNode, newNode); } else { const { first, rest } = node; const newNode = { first, rest }; tail.rest = newNode; return copy(node.rest, head, newNode); } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01167))_

> This algorithm makes copies of nodes as it goes, and mutates the last node in the list so that it can splice the next one on.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01168))_

> Armed with this basic copy implementation, we can write mapWith :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01169))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, node, head = null , tail = null ) => { if (node === EMPTY) { return head; } else if (tail === null ) { const { first, rest } = node; const newNode = { first: fn(first), rest }; return mapWith(fn, rest, newNode, newNode); } else { const { first, rest } = node; const newNode = { first: fn(first), rest }; tail.rest = newNode; return mapWith(fn, node.rest, head, newNode); } } mapWith((x) => 1.0 / x, OneToFive)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01170))_

```
//=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":0.5,"rest":{"first":0.3333333333333333,"rest":\ {"first":0.25,"rest":{"first":0.2,"rest":{}}}}}}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01171))_

## Reassignment

- Like some imperative programming languages, JavaScript allows you to re-assign the value bound to parameters. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01173))_
- JavaScript does not permit us to rebind a name that has been bound with const . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01178))_
- What we want is a statement that works like const , but permits us to rebind variables. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01179))_
- The key is to understand that we are rebinding a different value to the same name in the same environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01181))_
- Using let to bind 50 to age within the block does not change the binding of age in the outer environment because the binding of age in the block shadows the binding of age in the outer environment, just like const . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01184))_
- Using let to bind 50 to age within the block does not change the binding of age in the outer environment because the binding of age in the block shadows the binding of age in the outer environment, just like const . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01184))_
- However, if we don't shadow age with let , reassigning within the block changes the original: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01187))_
- Like evaluating variable labels, when a binding is rebound, JavaScript searches for the binding in the current environment and then each ancestor in turn until it finds one. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01189))_
- Like evaluating variable labels, when a binding is rebound, JavaScript searches for the binding in the current environment and then each ancestor in turn until it finds one. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01189))_
- It then rebinds the name in that environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01189))_

> For example, we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01174))_

> By default, JavaScript permits us to rebind new values to names bound with a parameter. For example, we can write:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01174))_

```
const evenStevens = (n) => { if (n === 0) { return true ; } else if (n == 1) { return false ; } else { n = n - 2; return evenStevens(n); } } evenStevens(42) //=> true
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01175))_

> The line n = n -2; rebinds a new value to the name n . We will discuss this at much greater length in Reassignment, but long before we do, let's try a similar thing with a name bound using const . We've already bound evenStevens using const , let's try rebinding it:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01176))_

```
evenStevens = (n) => { if (n === 0) { return true ; } else if (n == 1) { return false ; } else { return evenStevens(n - 2); } } //=> ERROR, evenStevens is read-only
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01177))_

> We can shadow it by using const to declare a new binding with a new function or block scope, but we cannot rebind a name that was bound with const in an existing scope.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01178))_

```
let age = 52; age = 53; age //=> 53
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01180))_

> So let's consider what happens with a shadowed variable:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01182))_

```
(() => { let age = 49; if ( true ) { let age = 50; } return age; })() //=> 49
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01183))_

```
{age: 49, '..': global-environment} To: {age: 50, '..': {age: 49, '..': global-environment}} Then back to:
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01185))_

## mixing let and const

- The suggestion is that shadowing a variable is confusing code. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01191))_
- If you dislike deliberately shadowing variables, you'll probably take an even more opprobrious view of mixing const and let semantics with a shadowed variable: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01192))_
- Shadowing a let with a const does not change our ability to rebind the variable in its original scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01194))_
- Shadowing a const with a let does not permit it to be rebound in its original scope. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01196))_

```
(() => { let age = 49; if ( true ) { const age = 50; } age = 51; return age; })() //=> 51
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01193))_

```
(() => { const age = 49; if ( true ) { let age = 50; } age = 52; return age; })() //=> ERROR: age is read-only
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01195))_

## var

- JavaScript has one more way to bind a name to a value, var . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01198))_
- First, var is not block scoped, it's function scoped, just like function declarations: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01202))_
- Declaring age twice does not cause an error(!), and the inner declaration does not shadow the outer declaration. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01204))_
- But, again, it is unwise to expect consistency. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01205))_
- But it's not like const and let in that it's function scoped, not block scoped. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01211))_

```
const factorial = (n) => { let x = n; if (x === 1) { return 1; } else { --x; return n * factorial(x); } } factorial(5) //=> 120 const factorial2 = (n) => { var x = n; if (x === 1) { return 1; } else { --x;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01199))_

```
return n * factorial2(x); } } factorial2(5) //=> 120
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01201))_

```
(() => { var age = 49; if ( true ) { var age = 50; } return age; })() //=> 50
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01203))_

> A function declaration can appear anywhere within a function, but the declaration and the definition are hoisted.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01205))_

```
const factorial = (n) => { return innerFactorial(n, 1); function innerFactorial (x, y) { if (x == 1) { return y; } else { return innerFactorial(x-1, x * y); } } } factorial(4) //=> 24
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01206))_

```
const factorial = (n) => { let innerFactorial = function innerFactorial (x, y) { if (x == 1) { return y; } else { return innerFactorial(x-1, x * y); } } return innerFactorial(n, 1); } JavaScript hoists the let and the assignment. But not so with var : const factorial = (n) => { return innerFactorial(n, 1); var innerFactorial = function innerFactorial (x, y) { if (x == 1) { return y; } else { return innerFactorial(x-1, x * y); } } } factorial(4) //=> undefined is not a function (evaluating 'innerFactorial(n, 1)')
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01208))_

```
const factorial = (n) => { let innerFactorial = undefined ; return innerFactorial(n, 1); innerFactorial = function innerFactorial (x, y) { if (x == 1) { return y; } else { return innerFactorial(x-1, x * y); } } } factorial(4) //=> undefined is not a function (evaluating 'innerFactorial(n, 1)')
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01210))_

> In that way, var is a little like const and let , we should always declare and bind names before using them.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01211))_

## why const and let were invented

- However, its functional scope was a problem. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01213))_
- For nearly twenty years, variables were declared with var (not counting parameters and function declarations, of course). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01213))_
- We haven't looked at it yet, but JavaScript provides a for loop for your iterating pleasure and convenience. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01214))_

```
var sum = 0; for ( var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { sum = sum + i } sum #=> 5050
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01215))_

> Hopefully, you can think of a faster way to calculate this sum. 72 And perhaps you have noticed that var i = 1 is tucked away instead of being at the top as we prefer. But is this ever a problem?
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01216))_

> Hopefully, you can think of a faster way to calculate this sum.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01216))_

> 72 There is a well known story about Karl Friedrich Gauss when he was in elementary school. His teacher got mad at the class and told them to add the numbers 1 to 100 and give him the answer by the end of the class. About 30 seconds later Gauss gave him the answer. The other kids were adding the numbers like this: 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . . + 99 + 100 = ? But Gauss rearranged the numbers to add them like this: (1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + . . . . + (50 + 51) = ? If you notice every pair of numbers adds up to 101. There are 50 pairs of numbers, so the answer is 50*101 = 5050. Of course Gauss came up with the answer about 20 times faster than the other kids.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01217))_

## Yes. Consider this variation:

- The answer is that pesky var i . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01224))_
- Now, at the time we created each function, i had a sensible value, like 0 , 1 , or 2 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01226))_
- But at the time we call one of the functions, i has the value 3 , which is why the loop terminated. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01226))_
- So when the function is called, JavaScript looks i up in its enclosing environment (its closure, obviously), and gets the value 3 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01226))_
- So when the function is called, JavaScript looks i up in its enclosing environment (its closure, obviously), and gets the value 3 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01226))_
- This small error was a frequent cause of confusion, and in the days when there was no block-scoped let , programmers would need to know how to fake it, usually with an IIFE: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01229))_
- This works, but let is so much simpler and cleaner that it was added to the language in the ECMAScript 2015 specification. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01231))_
- The purpose of your own code is to get things done. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01232))_
- The two goals are often, but not always, aligned. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01232))_

```
var introductions = [], names = ['Karl', 'Friedrich', 'Gauss']; for ( var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { introductions[i] = "Hello, my name is " + names[i] } introductions //=> [ 'Hello, my name is Karl', // 'Hello, my name is Friedrich', // 'Hello, my name is Gauss' ]
```

## Copy on Write

- We've seen how to build lists with arrays and with linked lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01235))_
- - When you take the rest of an array with destructuring ( [first, ...rest] ), you are given a copy of the elements of the array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01236))_
- - When you take the rest of a linked list with its reference, you are given the exact same nodes of the elements of the original list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01237))_
- And therefore, modifications to the parent do not affect the child, and modifications to the child do not affect the parent. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01238))_
- The consequence of this is that if you have an array, and you take it's 'rest,' your 'child' array is a copy of the elements of the parent array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01238))_
- And therefore, modifications to the parent do not affect the child, and modifications to the child do not affect the parent. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01238))_
- Whereas if you have a linked list, and you take it's 'rest,' your 'child' list shares its nodes with the 'parent' list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01239))_
- Whereas if you have a linked list, and you take it's 'rest,' your 'child' list shares its nodes with the 'parent' list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01239))_
- And therefore, modifications to the parent also modify the child, and modifications to the child also modify the parent. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01239))_
- We'll end up reinventing reference counting and garbage collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01242))_

```
const parentArray = [1, 2, 3]; const [aFirst, ...childArray] = parentArray; parentArray[2] = "three"; childArray[0] = "two"; parentArray //=> [1,2,"three"] childArray //=> ["two",3] const EMPTY = { first: {}, rest: {} }; const parentList = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY }\ }}; const childList = parentList.rest; parentList.rest.rest.first = "three"; childList.first = "two"; parentList //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":"two","rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":\ {},"rest":{}}}}} childList //=> {"first":"two","rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":{},"rest":{}}}}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01241))_

> If we know that a list doesn't share any elements with another list, we can safely modify it.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01242))_

## a few utilities

> before we go any further, let's write a few naïve list utilities so that we can work at a slightly higher level of abstraction:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01244))_

```
const copy = (node, head = null , tail = null ) => { if (node === EMPTY) { return head; } else if (tail === null ) { const { first, rest } = node; const newNode = { first, rest }; return copy(rest, newNode, newNode); } else { const { first, rest } = node; const newNode = { first, rest }; tail.rest = newNode; return copy(node.rest, head, newNode); } } const first = ({first, rest}) => first; const rest = ({first, rest}) => rest; const reverse = (node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : reverse(rest(node), { first: first(node), rest: delayed }); const mapWith = (fn, node, delayed = EMPTY) => node === EMPTY ? reverse(delayed) : mapWith(fn, rest(node), { first: fn(first(node)), rest: delayed }); const at = (index, list) => index === 0 ? first(list) : at(index - 1, rest(list)); const set = (index, value, list, originalList = list) => index === 0 ? (list.first = value, originalList) : set(index - 1, value, rest(list), originalList) const parentList = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY }\ }};
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01245))_

```
const childList = rest(parentList); set(2, "three", parentList); set(0, "two", childList); parentList //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":"two","rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":\ {},"rest":{}}}}} childList //=> {"first":"two","rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":{},"rest":{}}}}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01246))_

> Our new at and set functions behave similarly to array[index] and array[index] = value . The main difference is that array[index] = value evaluates to value , while set(index, value, list) evaluates to the modified list .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01247))_

## copy-on-read

- Whenever we take the rest of a list, make a copy. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01249))_
- One strategy for avoiding problems is to be pessimistic . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01249))_
- This strategy is called 'copy-on-read', because when we attempt the parent to 'read' the value of a child of the list, we make a copy and read the copy of the child. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01251))_
- This strategy is called 'copy-on-read', because when we attempt the parent to 'read' the value of a child of the list, we make a copy and read the copy of the child. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01251))_
- As we expected, making a copy lets us modify the copy without interfering with the original. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01252))_
- Sometimes we don't need to make a copy because we won't be modifying the list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01252))_
- Our mapWith function would be very expensive if we make a copy every time we call rest(node) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01252))_
- Sometimes we don't need to make a copy because we won't be modifying the list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01252))_

```
const rest = ({first, rest}) => copy(rest); const parentList = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY }\ }}; const childList = rest(parentList); const newParentList = set(2, "three", parentList); set(0, "two", childList); parentList //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":{},"\ rest":{}}}}} childList //=> {"first":"two","rest":{"first":3,"rest":{"first":{},"rest":{}}}}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01250))_

> Thereafter, we can write to the parent or the copy of the child freely.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01251))_

## copy-on-write

- But our new parent and child lists are copies that contain the desired modifications, without interfering with each other: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01259))_
- And now functions like mapWith that make copies without modifying anything, work at full speed. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01261))_
- This strategy of waiting to copy until you are writing is called copy-on-write, or 'COW:' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01262))_
- This strategy of waiting to copy until you are writing is called copy-on-write, or 'COW:' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01262))_
- Like all strategies, it makes a tradeoff: It's much cheaper than pessimistically copying structures when you make an infrequent number of small changes, but if you tend to make a lot of changes to some that you aren't sharing, it's more expensive. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01264))_
- Once we're done with it and give it to someone else, we need to be conservative and use a strategy like copy-on-read or copy-on-write. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01265))_

```
const rest = ({first, rest}) => rest; const set = (index, value, list) => index === 0 ? { first: value, rest: list.rest } : { first: list.first, rest: set(index - 1, value, list.rest) }; const parentList = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY }\ }}; const childList = rest(parentList); const newParentList = set(2, "three", parentList); const newChildList = set(0, "two", childList);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01256))_

```
parentList //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":3,"rest":{"first":{},"rest":\ {}}}}} childList //=> {"first":2,"rest":{"first":3,"rest":{"first":{},"rest":{}}}}
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01258))_

```
newParentList //=> {"first":1,"rest":{"first":2,"rest":{"first":"three","rest":{"first":{},"\ rest":{}}}}} newChildList //=> {"first":"two","rest":{"first":3,"rest":{"first":{},"rest":{}}}}

## Tortoises, Hares, and Teleporting Turtles

- It was, 'Write an algorithm to detect a loop in a linked list, in constant space.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01268))_
- This is the 'trick answer' to a question about finding a missing integer from a list, so I was trying the old, 'Transform this into a problem you've already solved 74 ' meta-algorithm. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01270))_
- Eventually, I came up with something and tried it (In Java!) on my home PC. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01271))_
- I then forgot about it for a while. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01271))_
- You have two node references, and one traverses the list at twice the speed of the other. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01275))_
- No matter how large it is, you will eventually have the fast reference equal to the slow reference, and thus you'll detect the loop. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01275))_
- No matter how large it is, you will eventually have the fast reference equal to the slow reference, and thus you'll detect the loop. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01275))_
- It seems to be faster under certain circumstances, depending on the size of the loop and the relative costs of certain operations. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01278))_
- What's interesting about these two algorithms is that they both tangle two separate concerns: How to traverse a data structure, and what to do with the elements that you encounter. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01279))_

## Functional Iterators

- The nice thing about this is that the definition for arraySum mostly concerns itself with summing, and not with traversing over a collection of data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01286))_
- Perhaps we could extract both of those things. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01288))_
- Well, we call arraySum with an array, and it has baked into it a method for traversing the array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01288))_
- We've found another way to express the principle of separating traversing a data structure from the operation we want to perform on that data structure, we've completely separated the knowledge of how to sum from the knowledge of how to fold an array or tree (or anything else, really). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01293))_

## iterating

- Nevertheless, there is some value in being able to express some algorithms as iteration. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01295))_
- JavaScript has a particularly low-level version of for loop that mimics the semantics of the C language. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01296))_
- And worst of all, we're getting really low-level with details like knowing that the elements of an array are indexed with consecutive integers that begin with 0 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01298))_
- Notice that buried inside our loop, we have bound the names done and value . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01301))_
- Notice that buried inside our loop, we have bound the names done and value . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01301))_
- Now this is something else. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01304))_

> Folding is a universal operation, and with care we can accomplish any task with folds that could be accomplished with that stalwart of structured programming, the for loop.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01295))_

> Summing the elements of an array can be accomplished with:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01296))_

```
const arraySum = (array) => { let sum = 0; for ( let i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) { sum += array[i]; } return sum } arraySum([1, 4, 9, 16, 25]) //=> 55
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01297))_

> We can write this a slightly different way, using a while loop:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01299))_

```
const arraySum = (array) => { let done, sum = 0, i = 0; while ((done = i == array.length, !done)) { const value = array[i++]; sum += value; } return sum } arraySum([1, 4, 9, 16, 25]) //=> 55

All the summing code needs to know is to add eachIteration.value . Now we can extract the ickiness into a separate function: const arrayIterator = (array) => { let i = 0; return () => { const done = i === array.length; return { done, value: done ? undefined : array[i++] } } } const iteratorSum = (iterator) => { let eachIteration, sum = 0; while ((eachIteration = iterator(), !eachIteration.done)) {
```

## unfolding and laziness

- A function that starts with a seed and expands it into a data structure is called an unfold . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01313))_
- A function that starts with a seed and expands it into a data structure is called an unfold . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01313))_
- This business of going on forever has some drawbacks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01317))_
- We'll need an iterator that produces odd numbers. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01319))_
- Mapping and filtering iterators allows us to compose the parts we already have, rather than writing a tricky bit of code with ifs and whiles and boundary conditions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01324))_

> Iterators are functions. When they iterate over an array or linked list, they are traversing something that is already there. But they could just as easily manufacture the data as they go. Let's consider the simplest example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01309))_

```
const NumberIterator = (number = 0) => () => ({ done: false , value: number++ }) fromOne = NumberIterator(1); fromOne().value; //=> 1 fromOne().value; //=> 2 fromOne().value; //=> 3 fromOne().value; //=> 4 fromOne().value; //=> 5
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01310))_

```
const FibonacciIterator = () => { let previous = 0, current = 1; return () => { const value = current; [previous, current] = [current, current + previous]; return {done: false , value}; }; }; const fib = FibonacciIterator() fib().value //=> 1 fib().value //=> 1 fib().value //=> 2 fib().value //=> 3 fib().value //=> 5
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01312))_

> It's possible to write a generic unfold mechanism, but let's pass on to what we can do with unfolded iterators.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01313))_

> For starters, we can map an iterator, just like we map a collection:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01314))_

```
const mapIteratorWith = (fn, iterator) => () => { const {done, value} = iterator(); return ({done, value: done ? undefined : fn(value)}); } const squares = mapIteratorWith((x) => x * x, NumberIterator(1)); squares().value //=> 1 squares().value
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01315))_

```
//=> 4 squares().value //=> 9
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01316))_

> We can start with take , an easy function that returns an iterator that only returns a fixed number of elements:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01317))_

```
const take = (iterator, numberToTake) => { let count = 0; return () => { if (++count <= numberToTake) { return iterator(); } else { return {done: true }; } }; }; const toArray = (iterator) => { let eachIteration, array = []; while ((eachIteration = iterator(), !eachIteration.done)) { array.push(eachIteration.value); } return array; } toArray(take(FibonacciIterator(), 5)) //=> [1, 1, 2, 3, 5] toArray(take(squares, 5)) //=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01318))_

> We can write that directly:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01319))_

```
const odds = () => {
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01320))_

```
let number = 1; return () => { const value = number; number += 2; return {done: false , value}; } } const squareOf = callLeft(mapIteratorWith, (x) => x * x) toArray(take(squareOf(odds()), 5)) //=> [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01321))_

```
const filterIteratorWith = (fn, iterator) => () => { do { const {done, value} = iterator(); } while (!done && !fn(value)); return {done, value}; } const oddsOf = callLeft(filterIteratorWith, (n) => n % 2 === 1); toArray(take(squareOf(oddsOf(NumberIterator(1))), 5)) //=> [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01323))_

## bonus

- This is interesting, because it is lazy: It doesn't apply fn to every element in an iteration, just enough to find the first that passes the test. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01329))_
- This is interesting, because it is lazy: It doesn't apply fn to every element in an iteration, just enough to find the first that passes the test. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01329))_
- If array was very large, and fn very slow, this would consume a lot of unnecessary time. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01331))_
- JavaScript would apply fn to every element. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01331))_
- And if fn had some sort of side-effect, the program could be buggy. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01331))_

> Many programmers coming to JavaScript from other languages are familiar with three 'canonical' operations on collections: folding, filtering, and finding. In Smalltalk, for example, they are known as collect , select , and detect .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01326))_

```
const firstInIteration = (fn, iterator) => take(filterIteratorWith(fn, iterator), 1);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01328))_

```
const firstInArray = (fn, array) => array.filter(fn)[0];
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01330))_

## caveat

- Please note that unlike most of the other functions discussed in this book, iterators are stateful . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01333))_
- One is that while functions like take(...) appear to create an entirely new iterator, in reality they return a decorated reference to the original iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01333))_
- There are some important implications of stateful functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01333))_
- Please note that unlike most of the other functions discussed in this book, iterators are stateful . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01333))_

> For all intents and purposes, once you pass an iterator to a function, you can expect that you no longer 'own' that iterator, and that its state either has changed or will change.

## Making Data Out Of Functions

- They searched for a radically simpler set of tools that could accomplish all of the same things. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01339))_
- A very long time ago, mathematicians like Alonzo Church, Moses Schönfinkel, Alan Turning, and Haskell Curry and asked themselves if we really needed all these features to perform computations. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01339))_
- The oscin.es 77 library contains code for all of the standard combinators and for experimenting using the standard notation. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01342))_

> In our code so far, we have used arrays and objects to represent the structure of data, and we have extensively used the ternary operator to write algorithms that terminate when we reach a base case. For example, this length function uses a functions to bind values to names, POJOs to structure nodes, and the ternary function to detect the base case, the empty list.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01337))_

```
const EMPTY = {}; const OneTwoThree = { first: 1, rest: { first: 2, rest: { first: 3, rest: EMPTY \ } } }; OneTwoThree.first //=> 1 OneTwoThree.rest.first //=> 2 OneTwoThree.rest.rest.first //=> 3 const length = (node, delayed = 0) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : length(node.rest, delayed + 1); length(OneTwoThree) //=> 3
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01338))_

> We can model lists just using functions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01340))_

> They established that arbitrary computations could be represented a small set of axiomatic components. For example, we don't need arrays to represent lists, or even POJOs to represent nodes in a linked list. We can model lists just using functions.

## the kestrel and the idiot

- The identity function is a function that evaluates to whatever parameter you pass it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01351))_

> A constant function is a function that always returns the same thing, no matter what you give it. For example, (x) => 42 is a constant function that always evaluates to 42. The kestrel, or K , is a function that makes constant functions. You give it a value, and it returns a constant function that gives that value.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01348))_

> A constant function is a function that always returns the same thing, no matter what you give it.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01348))_

> For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01349))_

```
const K = (x) => (y) => x; const fortyTwo = K(42); fortyTwo(6) //=> 42 fortyTwo("Hello") //=> 42
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01350))_

```
K(6)(7) //=> 6 K(12)(24) //=> 12
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01353))_

> Given two values, we can say that K always returns the first value: K(x)(y) => x (that's not valid JavaScript, but it's essentially how it works).
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01354))_

> Now, an interesting thing happens when we pass functions to each other. Consider K(I) . From what we just wrote, K(x)(y) => x So K(I)(x) => I . Makes sense. Now let's tack one more invocation on: What is K(I)(x)(y) ? If K(I)(x) => I , then K(I)(x)(y) === I(y) which is y .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01355))_

```
Therefore, K(I)(x)(y) => y :
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01356))_

```
K(I)(6)(7) //=> 7 K(I)(12)(24) //=> 24
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01357))_

> Given two values, K(I) always returns the second value.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01358))_

```
K("primus")("secundus") //=> "primus" K(I)("primus")("secundus") //=> "secundus"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01359))_

> If we are not feeling particularly academic, we can name our functions:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01360))_

```
const first = K, second = K(I); first("primus")("secundus") //=> "primus" second("primus")("secundus") //=> "secundus"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01361))_

> Given two values, we can say that K always returns the first value, and given two values, K(I) always returns the second value.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01362))_

## backwardness

- Our first and second functions are a little different than what most people are used to when we talk about functions that access data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01364))_
- In both cases, the functions first and second know how the data is represented, whether it be an array or an object. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01368))_
- So if we wanted to use them with a two-element array, we'd need to have a piece of code that calls some code. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01369))_
- Our latin data structure is no longer a dumb data structure, it's a function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01372))_

```
const first = ([first, second]) => first, second = ([first, second]) => second; const latin = ["primus", "secundus"]; first(latin) //=> "primus" second(latin) //=> "secundus"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01365))_

```
const first = ({first, second}) => first, second = ({first, second}) => second; const latin = {first: "primus", second: "secundus"}; first(latin) //=> "primus" second(latin) //=> "secundus"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01367))_

```
const first = K, second = K(I); const latin = (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus"); latin(first) //=> "primus" latin(second) //=> "secundus"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01371))_

## the vireo

- For 'data' we access with K and K(I) , our 'structure' is the function (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus") . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01375))_
- For consistency with the way combinators are written as functions taking just one parameter, we'll curry 78 the function: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01377))_
- As an aside, the Vireo is a little like JavaScript's .apply function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01384))_
- It says, 'take these two values and apply them to this function.' There are other, similar combinators that apply values to functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01384))_
- It is known to most programmers as .tap . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01384))_
- One notable example is the 'thrush' or T combinator: It takes one value and applies it to a function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01384))_

> Given that our latin data is represented as the function (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus") , our obvious next step is to make a function that makes data. For arrays, we'd write cons = (first, second) => [first, second] . For objects we'd write: cons = (first, second) => {first, second} . In both cases, we take two parameters, and return the form of the data.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01374))_

```
(first, second) => (selector) => selector(first)(second)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01376))_

(first) => (second) => (selector) => selector(first)(second)

```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01380))_

## lists with functions as data

- Here's another look at linked lists using POJOs. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01387))_
- And with care, we can do amazing things like use functions to represent numbers, build more complex data structures like trees, and in fact, anything that can be computed can be computed using just functions and nothing else. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01395))_
- We used functions to replace arrays and POJOs, but we still use JavaScript's built-in operators to test for equality ( === ) and to branch ?: . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01397))_

```
const first = ({first, rest}) => first, rest = ({first, rest}) => rest, pair = (first, rest) => ({first, rest}), EMPTY = ({}); const l123 = pair(1, pair(2, pair(3, EMPTY))); first(l123) //=> 1 first(rest(l123)) //=> 2 first(rest(rest(l123))) //=3
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01388))_

> We can write length and mapWith functions over it:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01389))_

```
const length = (aPair) => aPair === EMPTY ? 0 : 1 + length(rest(aPair)); length(l123) //=> 3 const reverse = (aPair, delayed = EMPTY) => aPair === EMPTY ? delayed : reverse(rest(aPair), pair(first(aPair), delayed)); const mapWith = (fn, aPair, delayed = EMPTY) => aPair === EMPTY ? reverse(delayed) : mapWith(fn, rest(aPair), pair(fn(first(aPair)), delayed)); const doubled = mapWith((x) => x * 2, l123); first(doubled) //=> 2 first(rest(doubled)) //=> 4 first(rest(rest(doubled))) //=> 6 Can we do the same with the linked lists we build out of functions? Yes: const first = K, l123 = pair(1)(pair(2)(pair(3)(EMPTY)));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01390))_

```
rest = K(I), pair = V, EMPTY = (() => {}); const l123(first) //=> 1 l123(rest)(first)
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01391))_

```
//=> 2 return l123(rest)(rest)(first) //=> 3 We write them in a backwards way, but they seem to work. How about
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01392))_

```
const length = (aPair) => aPair === EMPTY ? 0 : 1 + length(aPair(rest)); length(l123) //=> 3 And mapWith ? const reverse = (aPair, delayed = EMPTY) => aPair === EMPTY ? delayed : reverse(aPair(rest), pair(aPair(first))(delayed)); const mapWith = (fn, aPair, delayed = EMPTY) => aPair === EMPTY ? reverse(delayed) : mapWith(fn, aPair(rest), pair(fn(aPair(first)))(delayed)); const doubled = mapWith((x) => x * 2, l123) doubled(first) //=> 2 doubled(rest)(first) //=> 4 doubled(rest)(rest)(first) //=> 6
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01394))_

## say 'please'

- This follows the philosophy we used with data structures: The function doing the work inspects the data structure. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01399))_
- Now we'll need to write first and rest functions for a list, and those names will collide with the first and rest we wrote for pairs. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01404))_
- We have managed to provide the exact same functionality that === and ?: provided, but using functions and nothing else. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01409))_

> We can reverse this: Instead of asking a pair if it is empty and then deciding what to do, we can ask the pair to do it for us.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01400))_

```
const length = (aPair) => aPair === EMPTY ? 0 : 1 + length(aPair(rest));
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01401))_

```
const pairFirst = K, pairRest = K(I), pair = V; const first = (list) => list( () => "ERROR: Can't take first of an empty list", (aPair) => aPair(pairFirst) ); const rest = (list) => list(
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01405))_

```
() => "ERROR: Can't take first of an empty list", (aPair) => aPair(pairRest) ); const length = (list) => list( () => 0, (aPair) => 1 + length(aPair(pairRest))) ); We'll also write a handy list printer: const print = (list) => list( () => "", (aPair) => ` ${ aPair(pairFirst) } ${ print(aPair(pairRest)) } ` ); How would all this work? Let's start with the obvious. What is an empty list? const EMPTYLIST = (whenEmpty, unlessEmpty) => whenEmpty() And what is a node of a list? const node = (x) => (y) => (whenEmpty, unlessEmpty) => unlessEmpty(pair(x)(y)); Let's try it: const l123 = node(1)(node(2)(node(3)(EMPTYLIST))); print(l123) //=> 1 2 3
```

```
const reverse = (list, delayed = EMPTYLIST) => list( () => delayed, (aPair) => reverse(aPair(pairRest), node(aPair(pairFirst))(delayed)) ); print(reverse(l123)); //=> 3 2 1 const mapWith = (fn, list, delayed = EMPTYLIST) => list( () => reverse(delayed), (aPair) => mapWith(fn, aPair(pairRest), node(fn(aPair(pairFirst)))(delayed)) ); print(mapWith(x => x * x, reverse(l123))) //=> 941

## functions are not the real point

- There are lots of similar texts explaining how to construct complex semantics out of functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01411))_
- Functions are a fundamental building block of computation. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01413))_
- Practically speaking, languages like JavaScript already provide arrays with mapping and folding methods, choice operations, and other rich constructs. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01414))_
- However, that is not the interesting thing to note here. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01414))_
- Knowing how to make a linked list out of functions is not really necessary for the working programmer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01414))_
- Knowing how to make a list out of just functions is a little like knowing that photons are the Gauge Bosons 81 of the electromagnetic force. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01415))_

## a return to backward thinking

- To make pairs work, we did things backwards , we passed the first and rest functions to the pair, and the pair called our function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01421))_
- But we could have done something completely different. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01422))_
- We could have written a pair that stored its elements in an array, or a pair that stored its elements in a POJO. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01422))_
- The exact implementation of a pair is hidden from the code that uses a pair. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01423))_
- This is a little gratuitous, but it makes the point: The code that uses the data doesn't reach in and touch it: The code that uses the data provides some code and asks the data to do something with it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01425))_
- We then ask list to do it, and provide a way for list to call the code we pass in. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01428))_
- We're passing list what we want done with an empty list, and what we want done with a list that has at least one element. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01428))_
- We then ask list to do it, and provide a way for list to call the code we pass in. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01428))_
- We can fix this with an isEmpty function, but now we're pushing even more knowledge about the structure of lists into the code that uses them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01431))_
- It presumes there is one canonical empty list value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01431))_
- Having a list know itself whether it is empty hides implementation information from the code that uses lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01432))_
- This is a fundamental principle of good design. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01432))_
- There are many tools for hiding implementation information, and we have now seen two particularly powerful patterns: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01433))_
- - Instead of directly manipulating part of an entity, pass it a function and have it call our function with the part we want. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01434))_

> All we know is that we can pass the pair function a function of our own, at it will be called with the elements of the pair.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01422))_

```
const first = K, second = K(I), pair = (first) => (second) => { const pojo = {first, second}; return (selector) => selector(pojo.first)(pojo.second); }; const latin = pair("primus")("secundus"); latin(first) //=> "primus" latin(second) //=> "secundus"
```

const length = (list) => list( () => 0, (aPair) => 1 + length(aPair(pairRest))) );
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01427))_

```
const length = (node, delayed = 0) => node === EMPTY ? delayed : length(node.rest, delayed + 1);
```

> It presumes you can compare these things with the === operator.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01431))_

> It is a tenet of Object-Oriented Programming, but it is not exclusive to OOP: We can and should design data structures to hide implementation information from the code that use them, whether we are working with functions, objects, or both.

## mapWith

- But for the purposes of discussing ideas, we can use the same name twice in two different contexts. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01451))_
- 82 Yes, we also used the name mapWith for working with ordinary collections elsewhere. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01451))_
- It's the same idea, after all. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01451))_
- If we didn't use mapWith , we'd could have also used callRight with map to accomplish the same result: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01453))_
- mapWith is a very convenient abstraction for a very common pattern. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01455))_

> In JavaScript, arrays have a .map method. Map takes a function as an argument, and applies it to each of the elements of the array, then returns the results in another array. For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01441))_

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(x => x * x) //=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01442))_

```
const map = (list, fn) => list.map(fn);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01444))_

```
const mapWith = (fn) => (list) => list.map(fn);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01446))_

> That means that you can pass a function to mapWith and get back a function that applies that mapping to any array. For example, we might need a function to return the squares of an array. Instead of writing a a wrapper around .map :

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01450))_

> If we were writing a library of functions, we would have to disambiguate the two kinds of mapping functions with special names, namespaces, or modules.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01451))_

```
const squaresOf = mapWith(n => n * n); squaresOf([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) //=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01452))_

## Flip

```
const flipAndCurry = (fn) => (first) => (second) => fn(second, first); Sometimes you want to flip, but not curry: const flip = (fn) => (first, second) => fn(second, first); This is gold. Consider how we define mapWith now: var mapWith = flipAndCurry(map); Much nicer!
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01476))_

## self-currying flip

- Sometimes we'll want to flip a function, but retain the flexibility to call it in its curried form (pass one parameter) or non-curried form (pass both). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01478))_

```
const flip = (fn) => function (first, second) { if (arguments.length === 2) { return fn(second, first); } else { return function (second) { return fn(second, first); }; }; };
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01479))_

> Nowif we write mapWith = flip(map) , we can call mapWith(fn, list) or mapWith(fn)(list) , our choice.

> Nowif we write mapWith = flip(map) , we can call mapWith(fn, list) or mapWith(fn)(list) , our choice.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01480))_

## flipping methods

> When we learn about context and methods, we'll see that flip throws the current context away, so it can't be used to flip methods.

const flipAndCurry = (fn) => (first) => function (second) { return fn.call( this , second, first); } const flip = (fn) => function (first, second) { return fn.call( this , second, first); } const flip = (fn) => function (first, second) { if (arguments.length === 2) { return fn.call( this , second, first); } else { return function (second) { return fn.call( this , second, first); }; }; };

## Why?

- This has little practical utility in JavaScript, but in combinatory logic it's essential: With fixed-point combinators it's possible to compute everything computable without binding names. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01501))_
- It enables you to make recursive functions without needing to bind a function to a name in an environment. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01501))_
- Well, besides all of the practical applications that combinators provide, there is this little thing called The joy of working things out. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01502))_
- There are many explanations of the Y Combinator's mechanism on the internet, but resist the temptation to read any of them: Work it out for yourself. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01503))_
- Another friendly tip: Change some of the fat arrow functions inside of it into named function expressions to help you decipher stack traces. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01506))_
- Another friendly tip: Change some of the fat arrow functions inside of it into named function expressions to help you decipher stack traces. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01506))_

```
This is the canonical Y Combinator 86 : const Y = (f) => ( x => f(v => x(x)(v)) )( x => f(v => x(x)(v)) ); You use it like this: const factorial = Y( function (fac) { (n == 0 ? 1 : n * fac(n - 1));
```

return function (n) { return } }); factorial(5) //=> 120

## A Warm Cup: Basic Strings and Quasi-Literals

- Coffee and a Book An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.-Mozilla Development Network: Expressions and operators 87 _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01510))_
- Writing is a big part of what makes us human, and strings are how JavaScript and most other languages represent writing. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01514))_
- String manipulation is extremely common in programming. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01514))_

> Special characters can be included in a string literal by means of an escape sequence .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01511))_

> Like most programming languages, JavaScript also has string literals, like 'fubar' or 'fizzbuzz' . Special characters can be included in a string literal by means of an escape sequence . For example, the escape sequence \n inserts a newline character in a string literal, like this: 'first line\nsecond line' .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01511))_

> There are operators that can be used on strings.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01512))_

```
'fu' + 'bar' //=> 'fubar'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01513))_

## quasi-literals

- The expression is evaluated, and the result is coerced to a string, then inserted in the quasi-string. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01518))_
- The expression is evaluated, and the result is coerced to a string, then inserted in the quasi-string. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01518))_
- Aquasi-literal is computationally equivalent to an expression using + . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01521))_
- Quasi-literals are expressions that resemble their result. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01524))_
- However, there is a big semantic difference between a quasi-literal and an expression. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01524))_

> JavaScript supports quasi-literal strings , a/k/a 'Template Strings' or 'String Interpolation Expressions.' A quasi-literal string is something that looks like a string literal, but is actually an expression. Quasi-literal strings are denoted with back quotes, and most strings that can be expressed as literals have the exact same meaning as quasi-literals, e.g.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01516))_

> Quasi-literal strings are denoted with back quotes, and most strings that can be expressed as literals have the exact same meaning as quasi-literals, e.g.

```
`foobar` //=> 'foobar' `fizz` + `buzz` //=> 'fizzbuzz'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01517))_

> A quasi-literal can contain an expression to be evaluated.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01518))_

> For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01519))_

```
`A popular number for nerds is ${ 40 + 2 } ` //=> 'A popular number for nerds is 42'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01520))_

```
'A popular number for nerds is ' + (40 + 2) //=> 'A popular number for nerds is 42'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01523))_

```
'A popular number for nerds is' + (40 + 2) //=> 'A popular number for nerds is42'
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01525))_

## evaluation time

- Like any other expression, quasi-literals are evaluated late , when that line or lines of code is evaluated. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01527))_
- JavaScript evaluates the quasi-literal when the function is invoked and the quasi-literal inside the function's body is evaluated. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01530))_
- Thus, name is not bound to "Harry" , it is bound to 'Arthur Dent' , the value of the parameter when the function is invoked. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01530))_

- We could save a step and write collectionSum , a function that folds over any object, provided that the object implements an .iterator method: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01550))_
- Our functions don't need to know anything about how an object implements iteration, and we get the benefit of lazily traversing our objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01552))_

> We can do the same thing for objects.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01541))_

```
const Stack1 = () => ({ array:[], index: -1, push (value) { return this .array[ this .index += 1] = value; }, pop () { const value = this .array[ this .index]; this .array[ this .index] = undefined ; if ( this .index >= 0) { this .index -= 1 } return value }, isEmpty () { return this .index < 0 }, iterator () { let iterationIndex = this .index; return () => { if (iterationIndex > this .index) { iterationIndex = this .index; } if (iterationIndex < 0) { return {done: true }; } else { return {done: false , value: this .array[iterationIndex--]} } } } }); const stack = Stack1(); stack.push("Greetings"); stack.push("to"); stack.push("you!")
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01542))_

```
const iter = stack.iterator(); iter().value //=> "you!" iter().value //=> "to"
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01543))_

```
The .iterator() method is defined with shorthand equivalent to iterator: function iterator() { ... } . Note that it uses the function keyword, so when we invoke it with stack.iterator() , JavaScript sets this to the value of stack . But what about the function .iterator() returns? It is defined with a fat arrow () => { ... } . What is the value of this within that function? Since JavaScript doesn't bind this within a fat arrow function, we follow the same rules of variable scoping as any other variable name: We check in the environment enclosing the function. Although the .iterator() method has returned, its environment is the one that encloses our () => { ... } function, and that's where this is bound to the value of stack . Therefore, the iterator function returned by the .iterator() method has this bound to the stack object, even though we call it with iter() .
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01545))_

```
const iteratorSum = (iterator) => { let eachIteration, sum = 0; while ((eachIteration = iterator(), !eachIteration.done)) { sum += eachIteration.value; } return sum }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01547))_

> We can use it with our stack:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01548))_

const stack = Stack1(); stack.push(1); stack.push(2); stack.push(3); iteratorSum(stack.iterator()) //=> 6
```

const collectionSum = (collection) => { const iterator = collection.iterator(); let eachIteration, sum = 0; while ((eachIteration = iterator(), !eachIteration.done)) { sum += eachIteration.value; } return sum } collectionSum(stack) //=> 6
```

## iterator objects

- For simple linear collections like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, functional iterators are the simplest and easiest way to implement iterators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01555))_
- Iteration for functions and objects has been around for many, many decades. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01555))_
- The mechanics of iterating can then be factored using the same tools that are used to factor the mechanics of all other objects in the system. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01556))_
- The mechanics of iterating can then be factored using the same tools that are used to factor the mechanics of all other objects in the system. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01556))_
- Instead of having a function that you call to get the next element, you have an object with a .next() method. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01557))_
- Fortunately, an iterator object is almost as simple as an iterator function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01557))_

> In programs involving large collections of objects, it can be handy to implement iterators as objects, rather than functions.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01556))_

## Like this:

- Now our .iterator() method is returning an iterator object. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01561))_
- When working with objects, we do things the object way. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01561))_

```
const Stack2 = () => ({ array: [], index: -1, push (value) { return this .array[ this .index += 1] = value; }, pop () { const value = this .array[ this .index]; this .array[ this .index] = undefined ; if ( this .index >= 0) { this .index -= 1 } return value }, isEmpty () { return this .index < 0 }, iterator () { let iterationIndex = this .index; return { next () { if (iterationIndex > this .index) { iterationIndex = this .index; } if (iterationIndex < 0) { return {done: true }; } else { return {done: false , value: this .array[iterationIndex--]} } } } } });
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01559))_

```
const stack = Stack2(); stack.push(2000); stack.push(10); stack.push(5) const collectionSum = (collection) => { const iterator = collection.iterator(); let eachIteration, sum = 0; while ((eachIteration = iterator.next(), !eachIteration.done)) { sum += eachIteration.value; } return sum } collectionSum(stack) //=> 2015
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01560))_

## iterables

- People have been writing iterators since JavaScript was first released in the late 1990s. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01563))_
- Since there was no particular standard way to do it, people used all sorts of methods, and their methods returned all sorts of things: Objects with various interfaces, functional iterators, you name it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01563))_
- Instead, the language encourages new code to be written with a different name for the method that a collection object uses to return its iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01564))_
- So, when a standard way to write iterators was added to the JavaScript language, it didn't make sense to use a method like .iterator() for it: That would conflict with existing code. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01564))_
- To ensure that the method would not conflict with any existing code, JavaScript provides a symbol . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01565))_
- Symbols are unique constants that are guaranteed not to conflict with existing strings. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01565))_
- Symbols are a longstanding technique in programming going back to Lisp, where the GENSYM function generated… You guessed it… Symbols. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01565))_
- Our stack does, so instead of binding the existing iterator method to the name iterator , we bind it to the Symbol.iterator . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01568))_
- The for...of loop works directly with any object that is iterable , meaning it works with any object that has a Symbol.iterator method that returns an object iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01571))_
- ) can spread the elements of an array in an array literal or as parameters in a function invocation. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01573))_
- And if we have an infinite collection, spreading is going to fail outright as we're about to see. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01580))_

> The expression Symbol.iterator evaluates to a special symbol representing the name of the method that objects should use if they return an iterator object.

```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01577))_

> This can be extremely useful.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01578))_

> One caveat of spreading iterables: JavaScript creates an array out of the elements of the iterable. That might be very wasteful for extremely large collections. For example, if we spread a large collection just to find an element in the collection, it might have been wiser to iterate over the element using its iterator directly.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01579))_

## iterables out to infinity

```
const Numbers = { [Symbol.iterator] () { let n = 0; return { next: () => ({done: false , value: n++}) } } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01583))_

> There are useful things we can do with iterables representing an infinitely large collection.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01584))_

```
['all the numbers', ...Numbers] //=> infinite loop! firstAndSecondElement(...Numbers) //=> infinite loop!
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01585))_

> Attempting to spread an infinite iterable into an array is always going to fail.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01586))_

## ordered collections

- This is accomplished with our own collections by returning a brand new iterator every time we call [Symbol.iterator] , and ensuring that our iterators start at the beginning and work forward. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01590))_
- Iterables needn't represent ordered collections. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01591))_
- Therefore, RandomNumbers is not an ordered collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01593))_
- Therefore, RandomNumbers is not an ordered collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01593))_
- To reiterate (hah), an ordered collection represents a (possibly infinite) collection of elements that are in some order. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01594))_
- Every time we get an iterator from an ordered collection, we start iterating from the beginning. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01594))_
- Right now, we're just looking at ordered collections. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01594))_

> The iterables we're discussing represent ordered collections . One of the semantic properties of an ordered collection is that every time you iterate over it, you get its elements in order, from the beginning. For example:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01588))_

```
const abc = ["a", "b", "c"]; for ( const i of abc) { console.log(i) } //=> a b c for ( const i of abc) { console.log(i) } //=> a b c
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01589))_

```
const RandomNumbers = { [Symbol.iterator]: () => ({ next () { return {value: Math.random()}; } }) } for ( const i of RandomNumbers) { console.log(i) } //=> 0.494052127469331 0.835459444206208 0.1408337657339871 ... for ( const i of RandomNumbers) { console.log(i) } //=> 0.7845381607767195 0.4956772483419627 0.20259276474826038 ...
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01592))_

> Whether you work with the same iterator over and over, or get a fresh iterable every time, you are always going to get fresh random numbers.

## operations on ordered collections

- Here's mapWith , it takes an ordered collection, and returns another ordered collection representing a mapping over the original: 89 _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01596))_
- But for the purposes of discussing ideas, we can use the same name twice in two different contexts. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01597))_
- 89 Yes, we also used the name mapWith for working with ordinary collections elsewhere. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01597))_
- It's the same idea, after all. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01597))_
- This illustrates the general pattern of working with ordered collections: We make them iterables , meaning that they have a [Symbol.iterator] method, that returns an iterator . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01599))_
- An iterator is also an object, but with a .next() method that is invoked repeatedly to obtain the elements in order. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01599))_
- Numbers is an ordered collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01602))_
- So, Evens is also an ordered collection, because it starts at the beginning each time we get a fresh iterator over it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01605))_
- Thus, mapWith has the property of preserving the collection semantics of the iterable we give it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01605))_
- So, Evens is also an ordered collection, because it starts at the beginning each time we get a fresh iterator over it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01605))_
- Thus, mapWith has the property of preserving the collection semantics of the iterable we give it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01605))_
- Like mapWith , they preserve the ordered collection semantics of whatever you give them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01612))_
- Andhere's a computation performed using operations on ordered collections: We'll create an ordered collection of square numbers that end in one and are less than 1,000: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01613))_
- As we expect from an ordered collection, each time we iterate over UpTo1000 , we begin at the beginning. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01615))_
- first returns the first element of an iterable (if it has one), and rest returns an iterable that iterates over all but the first element of an iterable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01616))_
- For completeness, here are two more handy iterable functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01616))_
- like our other operations, rest preserves the ordered collection semantics of its argument. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01618))_

> If we were writing a library of functions, we would have to disambiguate the two kinds of mapping functions with special names, namespaces, or modules.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01597))_

```
const mapWith = (fn, collection) => ({ [Symbol.iterator] () { const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator](); return { next () { const {done, value} = iterator.next(); return ({done, value: done ? undefined : fn(value)}); } } } });
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01598))_

> Many operations on ordered collections return another ordered collection. They do so by taking care to iterate over a result freshly every time we get an iterator for them. Consider this example for mapWith :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01600))_

```
const Evens = mapWith((x) => 2 * x, Numbers); for ( const i of Evens) { console.log(i) } //=> 0 2 4 ... for ( const i of Evens) { console.log(i) } //=> 0 2 4 ...
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01601))_

```
const Evens = { [Symbol.iterator] () { const iterator = Numbers[Symbol.iterator](); return { next () { const {done, value} = iterator.next(); return ({done, value: done ? undefined : 2 *value}); } } } };
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01603))_

> Every time we write for (const i of Evens) , JavaScript calls Evens[Symbol.iterator]() . That in turns means it executes const iterator = Numbers[Symbol.iterator](); every time we write for (const i of Evens) , and that means that iterator starts at the beginning of Numbers .
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01604))_

> Mind you, we can also map non-collection iterables, like RandomNumbers :
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01606))_

```
const ZeroesToNines = mapWith((n) => Math.floor(10 * limit), RandomNumbers); for ( const i of ZeroesToNines) { console.log(i) } //=> 5 1 9 ... for ( const i of ZeroesToNines) { console.log(i) } //=> 3
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01607))_

```
6 1 ...
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01608))_

> mapWith can get a new iterator from RandomNumbers each time we iterate over ZeroesToNines , but if RandomNumbers doesn't behave like an ordered collection, that's not mapWith 's fault.

## summary

- Iterators are a JavaScript feature that allow us to separate the concerns of how to iterate over a collection from what we want to do with the elements of a collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01629))_
- Separating concerns with iterators speaks to JavaScript's fundamental nature: It's a language that wants to compose functionality out of small, singe-responsibility pieces, whether those pieces are functions or objects built out of functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01630))_

## Generating Iterables

- Iterables look cool, but then again, everything looks amazing when you're given cherry-picked examples. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01633))_
- Iterables look cool, but then again, everything looks amazing when you're given cherry-picked examples. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01633))_
- The Numbers iterable returns an object that updates a mutable variable, n , to deliver number after number. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01637))_
- There is no concept of pushing numbers out from the iterator, just waiting until a number is pulled out of the iterator by whatever code consumes numbers. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01638))_
- Then it waits for the next request. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01638))_
- It waits until given a request, and then it returns exactly one item. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01638))_
- Of course, when we have some code that makes a bunch of something, we don't usually write it like that. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01639))_
- We would generate numbers. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01641))_
- And magically, the numbers would pour forth. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01641))_
- Well, there are some collections that are much easier to generate than to iterate over. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01643))_

> Let's consider how they work. Whether it's a simple functional iterator, or an iterable object with a .next() method, an iterator is something we call repeatedly until it tells us that it's done.

> Iterators have to arrange its own state such that when you call them, they compute and return the next item. This seems blindingly obvious and simple. If, for example, you want numbers, you write:

## recursive iterators

- One of those cases is when we have to recursively enumerate something. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01645))_
- Iterators maintain state, that's what they do. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01645))_

> Generators have to manage the exact same amount of state, but sometimes, it's much easier to manage that state in a generator.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01645))_

> For example, iterating over a tree. Given an array that might contain arrays, let's say we want to generate all the 'leaf' elements, i.e. elements that are not, themselves, iterable.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01646))_

```
// Generation const isIterable = (something) => !!something[Symbol.iterator]; const generate = (iterable) => { for ( let element of iterable) { if (isIterable(element)) { generate(element) } else { console.log(element) } } } generate([1, [2, [3, 4], 5]]) //=> 1 2 3 4 5
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01647))_

## // Iteration

- If you peel off isIterable and ignore the way that the iteration version uses [Symbol.iterator] and .next , we're left with the fact that the generating version calls itself recursively, and the iteration version maintains an explicit stack. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01651))_
- In essence, both the generation and iteration implementations have stacks, but the generation version's stack is implicit , while the iteration version's stack is explicit . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01651))_
- A less kind way to put it is that the iteration version is greenspunning something built into our programming language: We're reinventing the use of a stack to manage recursion, because writing our code to respond to a function call makes us turn a simple recursive algorithm inside-out. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01652))_

## state machines

- - The first element of the fibonacci sequence is zero. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01655))_
- - The second element of the fibonacci sequence is one. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01656))_
- - Every subsequent element of the fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous two elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01657))_
- The thing to note here is that our fibonacci generator has three states: generating 0 , generating 1 , and generating everything after that. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01661))_

_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01661))_

## We'll keep it simple:

- Again, this is not particularly horrendous, but like the recursive example, we're explicitly greenspunning the natural linear state. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01666))_
- So we see the same thing: The generation version has state, but it's implicit in JavaScript's linear control flow. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01667))_

```
// Iteration let a, b, state = 0; const fibonacci = () => { switch (state) { case 0: state = 1; return a = 0; case 1: state = 2; return b = 1; case 2: [a, b] = [b, a + b]; return b } }; while ( true ) { console.log(fibonacci()); } //=> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13

## javascript's generators

- Given the title of this chapter, it is not a surprise that JavaScript makes this possible. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01669))_
- It would be very nice if we could sometimes write iterators as a .next() method that gets called, and sometimes write out a generator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01669))_
- An iterator written in a generation style is called a generator . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01670))_
- An iterator written in a generation style is called a generator . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01670))_

- Invoking only more than once gives us fresh iterators each time: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01679))_
- It yields the value of something , and then it's done. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01683))_

> We can write an iterator, but use a generation style of programming.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01670))_

## generators are coroutines

- This is where generators behave very, very differently from ordinary functions. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01687))_
- - The iterator is in a nascent or 'newborn' state. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01689))_
- - When we call interator.next() , the body of our generator begins to be evaluated. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01690))_
- - The body of our generator runs until it returns, ends, or encounters a yield statement, which is yield 1; . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01691))_
- - The rest of the program continues along its way until it makes another call to iterator.next() . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01694))_
- - The iterator resumes execution from the point where it yielded the last value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01695))_
- - The body of our generator runs until it returns, ends, or encounters the next yield statement, which is yield 2; . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01696))_
- - The rest of the program continues along its way until it makes another call to iterator.next() . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01699))_
- - The iterator resumes execution from the point where it yielded the last value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01700))_
- - The body of our generator runs until it returns, ends, or encounters the next yield statement, which is yield 3; . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01701))_
- - The rest of the program continues along its way until it makes another call to iterator.next() . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01704))_
- - The iterator resumes execution from the point where it yielded the last value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01705))_
- - The body of our generator runs until it returns, ends, or encounters the next yield statement. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01706))_
- There are no more lines of code, so it ends. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01706))_
- Coroutines are well-suited for implementing more familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loop, iterators, infinite lists and pipes. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01709))_
- Coroutines are computer program components that generalize subroutines for nonpreemptive multitasking, by allowing multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at certain locations. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01709))_
- Coroutines are well-suited for implementing more familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loop, iterators, infinite lists and pipes. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01709))_
- With an iterator, we can call them the producer and the consumer . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01710))_
- The iterator is the producer, and the code that iterates over it is the consumer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01710))_
- But no matter how JavaScript implements it, our mental model is that a generator function returns an iterator, and that when we call .next() , it runs until it returns, ends, or yields. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01714))_
- If it yields, it suspends its own execution and the consuming code resumes execution, until .next() is called again, at which point the iterator resumes its own execution from the point where it yielded. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01714))_
- If it yields, it suspends its own execution and the consuming code resumes execution, until .next() is called again, at which point the iterator resumes its own execution from the point where it yielded. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01714))_

```
const oneTwoThree = function * () { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3; }; oneTwoThree().next() //=> {"done": false , value: 1} oneTwoThree().next() //=> {"done": false , value: 1} oneTwoThree().next() //=> {"done": false , value: 1} const iterator = oneTwoThree(); iterator.next() //=> {"done": false , value: 1} iterator.next() //=> {"done": false , value: 2} iterator.next() //=> {"done": false , value: 3} iterator.next() //=> {"done": true }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01686))_

> Instead of thinking of there being on execution context, we can imagine that there are two execution contexts.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01710))_

> Of course, generators need not be implemented exactly as coroutines. For example, a 'transpiler' might implement oneTwoThree as a state machine, a little like this (there is more to generators, but we'll see that later):
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01712))_

```
const oneTwoThree = function () { let state = 'newborn'; return { next () { switch (state) { case 'newborn': state = 1; return {value: 1}; case 1: state = 2; return {value: 2} case 2: state = 3; return {value: 3} case 3: return {done: true }; } } } };
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01713))_

## generators and iterables

- Our generator function oneTwoThree is not an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01716))_
- Recalling the way we wrote ordered collections, we could make a collection that uses a generator function: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01717))_
- As we saw above, we called oneTwoThree three times, and each time we got an iterator that begins at 1 and counts to 3 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01717))_
- This pattern is encouraged, so much so that JavaScript provides a concise syntax for writing generator methods for objects: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01720))_
- Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01722))_
- This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01722))_
- Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01722))_

> We write the function to yield values instead of return a single value, and JavaScript takes care of turning this into an object with a .next() function we can call.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01716))_

```
const ThreeNumbers = { [Symbol.iterator]: function * () { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3 } } for ( const i of ThreeNumbers) { console.log(i); } //=> 1 2 3 [...ThreeNumbers] //=> [1,2,3] const iterator = ThreeNumbers[Symbol.iterator](); iterator.next() //=> {"done": false , value: 1} iterator.next() //=> {"done": false , value: 2} iterator.next() //=> {"done": false , value: 3} iterator.next() //=> {"done": true }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01718))_

> Now we can use it in a for...of loop, spread it into an array literal, or spread it into a function invocation, because we have written an iterable that uses a generator to return an iterator from its [Symbol.iterator] method.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01719))_

```
const ThreeNumbers = { *[Symbol.iterator] () { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3 } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01721))_

## more generators

- Our OneTwoThree example used implicit state to output the numbers in sequence. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01728))_
- And the generator's syntax allows us to use JavaScript's natural management of state instead of constantly rolling our own. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01733))_
- We've writing a function that returns an iterator, but we used a generator to do it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01733))_

> Generators can produce infinite streams of values:

## yielding iterables

- If e is not an iterable, yield e . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01742))_

## Summary

- A generator is a function that is defined with function * and uses yield (or yield * ) to generate values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01767))_
- And we don't need to worry about wrapping our values in an object with .done and .value properties. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01767))_
- This is especially useful for making iterables. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01768))_

> Using a generator instead of writing an iterator object that has a .next() method allows us to write code that can be much simpler for cases like recursive iterations or state patterns.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01767))_

## Lazy and Eager Collections

- Composing an iterable with a mapIterable method cleaves the responsibility for knowing how to map from the fiddly bits of how a linked list differs from a stack _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01771))_
- in the older style of object-oriented programming, we built 'fat' objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01772))_
- If we wanted to flatten collections to arrays, we wrote a .toArray method for each type of collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01772))_
- Each collection knew how to map itself ( .map ), how to fold itself ( .reduce ), how to filter itself ( .filter ) and how to find one element within itself ( .find ). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01772))_
- We tell ourselves that, well, a collection ought to know how to map itself. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01773))_
- But we end up recreating the same bits of code in each .map method we create, in each .reduce method we create, in each .filter method we create, and in each .find method. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01774))_
- Each one has its own variation, but the overall form is identical. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01774))_
- That would be like saying that when we ask a bank teller for some cash, they personally print every bank note. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01775))_

> Some methods are only added to a few collections, some are added to all.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01773))_

> That's a sign that we should work at a higher level of abstraction, and working with iterables is that higher level of abstraction.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01774))_

> This 'fat object' style springs from a misunderstanding: When we say a collection should know how to perform a map over itself, we don't need for the collection to handle every single detail.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01775))_

## implementing methods with iteration

- And they should know how to accomplish the desired result, but they should do so by delegating as much of the work as possible to operations like mapWith . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01777))_
- Composing an iterable with a mapIterable method cleaves the responsibility for knowing how to map from the fiddly bits of how a linked list differs from a stack. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01778))_
- For simplicity, we'll show how to mix it into Numbers and Pair . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01784))_
- To use LazyCollection , we mix it into an any iterable object. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01784))_

> Object-oriented collections should definitely have methods for mapping, reducing, filtering, and finding.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01777))_

## lazy collection operations

- Thus, calling .map.filter.reduce produces two temporary arrays that are discarded when .reduce performs its final computation. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01795))_
- They produce small iterable objects that refer back to the original iteration. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01796))_
- Whereas the .map and .filter methods on Pair work with iterators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01796))_
- The effect is even more pronounced when we use methods like first , until , or take : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01797))_
- Same with .filter , we get an iterable that can iterate over the even squares, but not an actual stack or array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01799))_
- This expression begins with a stack containing 30 elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01799))_
- If we mutate a collection after taking an iterable, we might get an unexpected result. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01808))_
- This is why 'pure' functional languages like Haskell combine lazy semantics with immutable collections, and why even 'impure' languages like Clojure emphasize the use of immutable collections. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01808))_

- But there are other times we want to build functions that maintain implicit state. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01879))_
- x has six possible moves, but they are really just two choices: 3 and anything else: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01888))_

## We get:

## representing naughts and crosses as a stateful function

- In that case, we need a stateful function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01913))_
- Our 'API' will work like this: When we want a new game, we'll call a function that will return a game function, We'll call the game function repeatedly, passing our moves, and get the opponent's moves from it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01913))_
- The state is encoded entirely in data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01919))_

```
const aNaughtsAndCrossesGame = statefulNaughtsAndCrosses(); // our opponent makes the first move aNaughtsAndCrossesGame() //=> 0 // then we move, and get its next move back aNaughtsAndCrossesGame(1) //=> 6 // then we move, and get its next move back aNaughtsAndCrossesGame(4) //=> 3
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01915))_

> We can build this out of our statelessNaughtsAndCrosses function:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01916))_

```
const statefulNaughtsAndCrosses = () => { const state = [ ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ' ]; return (x = false ) => { if (x) {
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01917))_

```
if (state[x] === ' ') { state[x] = 'x'; } else throw "occupied!" } let o = moveLookupTable[state]; state[o] = 'o'; return o; } }; const aNaughtsAndCrossesGame = statefulNaughtsAndCrosses(); // our opponent makes the first move aNaughtsAndCrossesGame() //=> 0 // then we move, and get its next move back aNaughtsAndCrossesGame(1) //=> 6 // then we move, and get its next move back aNaughtsAndCrossesGame(4) //=> 3
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01918))_

## this seems familiar

- When we looked at generators, we saw that some iterators are inherently stateful, but sometimes it is awkward to represent them in a fully stateless fashion. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01921))_
- Sometimes there is a state machine that is naturally represented implicitly in JavaScript's control flow rather than explicitly in data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01921))_
- A game like this is absolutely a state machine, and we've explicitly coded those states into the lookup table. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01922))_
- Naughts and crosses is simple enough that the lookup function seems substantially simpler, in part because linear code doesn't represent trees particularly well. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01925))_
- Naughts and crosses is simple enough that the lookup function seems substantially simpler, in part because linear code doesn't represent trees particularly well. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01925))_
- With iterators, we wrote a generator function using function * , and then used yield to yield values while maintaining the implicit state of the generator's control flow. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01926))_

> If we were in full control of the interaction, it would be easy to encode the game play as a decision tree instead of as a lookup table. For example, we could do this in a browser:
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01923))_

```
function browserNaughtsAndCrosses () { const x1 = parseInt(prompt('o plays 0, where does x play?')); switch (x1) { case 1: const x2 = parseInt(prompt('o plays 6, where does x play?')); switch (x2) { case 2: case 4: case 5: case 7: case 8: alert('o plays 3'); break ; case 3: const x3 = parseInt(prompt('o plays 8, where does x play?')); switch (x3) { case 2: case 5: case 7: alert('o plays 4'); break ; case 4: alert('o plays 7'); break ; } } break ; // ... } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01924))_

> But we can clearly see that if we wanted to, we could represent the state of the program implicitly in a decision tree.
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01925))_

> But the first glance is deceptive, because we only see what we've seen so far.

## interactive generators

- So far, we have called iterators (and generators) with .next() . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01929))_
- It isn't a collection, it has no meaning if we try to spread it into parameters or as the subject of a for...of block. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01933))_
- But the generator function allows us to maintain state implicitly. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01934))_
- And sometimes, we want to use implicit state instead of explicitly storing state in our data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01934))_

```
function * generatorNaughtsAndCrosses () { const x1 = yield 0; switch (x1) { case 1: const x2 = yield 6; switch (x2) { case 2: case 4: case 5: case 7: case 8: yield 3; break ; case 3: const x3 = yield 8; switch (x3) { case 2: case 5: case 7: yield 4; break ; case 4: yield 7; break ;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01931))_

> } } const aNaughtsAndCrossesGame = generatorNaughtsAndCrosses(); We can then get the first move by calling .next() .

> Served by the Pot: Collections 260 } } break ; // ... } } const aNaughtsAndCrossesGame = generatorNaughtsAndCrosses(); We can then get the first move by calling .next() . Thereafter, we call .next(...) and pass in our moves (The very first call has to be .next() without any arguments, because the generator hasn't started yet. If we wanted to pass some state to the generator before it begins, we'd do that with parameters.): aNaughtsAndCrossesGame.next().value //=> 0 aNaughtsAndCrossesGame.next(1).value //=> 6 aNaughtsAndCrossesGame.next(3).value //=> 8 aNaughtsAndCrossesGame.next(7).value //=> 4
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01932))_

## summary

- We have looked at generators as ways of making iterators over static collections, where state is modelled implicitly in control flow. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01936))_
- Again, the salient difference is that an 'interactive' generator is stateful, and it embodies its state in its control flow. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01937))_

## Basic Operations on Iterables

- Here are the operations we've defined on Iterables. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01939))_

## operations that transform one iterable into another

```
function * mapWith(fn, iterable) { for ( const element of iterable) { yield fn(element); } } function * mapAllWith (fn, iterable) { for ( const element of iterable) { yield * fn(element); } } function * filterWith (fn, iterable) { for ( const element of iterable) { if (!!fn(element)) yield element; } } function * compact (iterable) { for ( const element of iterable) { if (element != null ) yield element; } } function * untilWith (fn, iterable) { for ( const element of iterable) { if (fn(element)) break ; yield fn(element); } } function * rest (iterable) { const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator](); iterator.next();
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01941))_

```
yield * iterator; } function * take (numberToTake, iterable) { const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator](); for ( let i = 0; i < numberToTake; ++i) { const { done, value } = iterator.next(); if (!done) yield value; } }
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01942))_

## operations that compose two or more iterables into an iterable

```
function * zip (...iterables) { const iterators = iterables.map(i => i[Symbol.iterator]()); while ( true ) { const pairs = iterators.map(j => j.next()), dones = pairs.map(p => p.done), values = pairs.map(p => p.value); if (dones.indexOf( true ) >= 0) break ; yield values; } }; function * zipWith (zipper, ...iterables) { const iterators = iterables.map(i => i[Symbol.iterator]()); while ( true ) { const pairs = iterators.map(j => j.next()), dones = pairs.map(p => p.done), values = pairs.map(p => p.value); if (dones.indexOf( true ) >= 0) break ; yield zipper(...values); } };
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01944))_

```
const zip = callFirst(zipWith, (...values) => values);
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01946))_

## operations that transform an iterable into a value

```
const reduceWith = (fn, seed, iterable) => { let accumulator = seed; for ( const element of iterable) { accumulator = fn(accumulator, element); } return accumulator; }; const first = (iterable) => iterable[Symbol.iterator]().next().value;
```
_(source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01948))_

## memoizing an iterable

```
function memoize (generator) { const memos = {}, iterators = {}; return function * (...args) { const key = JSON.stringify(args); let i = 0; if (memos[key] == null ) { memos[key] = []; iterators[key] = generator(...args); } while ( true ) { if (i < memos[key].length) { yield memos[key][i++]; } else { const { done, value } = iterators[key].next(); if (done) { return ; } else { yield memos[key][i++] = value;

### Needs review

- Like adding a splash of water to whiskey, the small dilution releases more of the complex flavours in the mouth. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00010))_
- This achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilution method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to the longer extraction. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00011))_
- JavaScript Allongé teaches you how to handle complex code, and it also teaches you how to simplify code without dumbing it down. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00017))_
- And presto, rest collects the rest of the arguments without a lot of malarky involving slicing arguments . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00036))_
- Thus, the focus on things like writing decorators. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00041))_
- But there's more to it than that . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00041))_
- And these techniques dovetail nicely with Allongé's focus on composing entities and working with functions. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00043))_
- It introduces iterators and generators. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00044))_
- It introduces the notion of implementing private properties with symbols. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00044))_
- Thus, the 'six' edition introduces classes and mixins. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00044))_
- We just call some of those functions constructors, others decorators, others functional mixins, and yet others, policies. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00045))_
- From functions flow many ideas, from decorators to methods to delegation to mixins, and onwards in so many fruitful directions. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00049))_
- There are reasons why the second form is more flexible, especially when used in combination with partial application, but does that outweigh the benefit of having an entire codebase do everything consistently the first way or the second way? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00058))_
- JavaScript Allongé introduces new aspects of programming with functions in each chapter, explaining exactly how JavaScript works. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00062))_
- This upgrade became ECMAScript 5. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00067))_
- Having written books myself, I know the pain of soliciting and receiving feedback. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00083))_
- Many books try to hide most of those capabilities away, giving you recipes for writing JavaScript in a way that approximates class-centric programming in other languages. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00091))_
- It starts with the fundamentals of values, functions, and objects, and then guides you through JavaScript from the inside with exploratory bits of code that illustrate scoping, combinators, context, state, prototypes, and constructors. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00091))_
- Like JavaScript itself, this book gives you a gentle start before showing you its full depth, and like a Cafe Allongé, it's over too soon. Enjoy! — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00093))_
- Besides, there's really no risk at all . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00097))_
- The following material is extremely basic, however like most stories, the best way to begin is to start at the very beginning. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00102))_
- Imagine we are visiting our favourite coffee shop. They will make for you just about any drink you desire, from a short, intense espresso ristretto through a dry cappuccino, up to those coffee-flavoured desert concoctions featuring various concentrated syrups and milks. (You tolerate the existence o — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00103))_
- You express your order at one end of their counter, the folks behind the counter perform their magic, and deliver the coffee you value at the other end. This is exactly how the JavaScript environment works for the purpose of this book. We are going to dispense with web servers, browsers and other co — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00104))_
- Say you hand the barista a café Cubano. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00108))_
- Is this an expression? A value? Neither? Or both? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00111))_
- 10 Technically, it's a representation of a value using Base10 notation, but we needn't worry about that in this book. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00119))_
- In JavaScript, we test whether two values are identical with the === operator, and whether they are not identical with the !== operator: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00123))_
- And then you're shown another cup of coffee. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00125))_
- Well, JavaScript's third and fourth possibilities cover that. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00130))_
- So what kinds of values might be the same type and have the same contents, but not be considered identical to JavaScript? Let's meet a data structure that is very common in contemporary programming languages, the Array (other languages sometimes call it a List or a Vector). — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00138))_
- An array looks like this: [1, 2, 3] . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00139))_
- 16 The simplest possible function is () => {} , we'll see that later. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00178))_
- Which kind are functions? Let's try them out and see. For reasons of appeasing the JavaScript parser, we'll enclose our functions in parentheses: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00182))_
- Here's how we apply a function to some values in JavaScript: Let's say that fn_expr is an expression that when evaluated, produces a function. Let's call the arguments args . Here's how to apply a function to some arguments: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00187))_
- Since we aren't giving it any arguments, we'll simply write () after the expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00189))_
- If not… Welcome to the ALGOL family of programming languages! — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00191))_
- It evaluates to the same thing, 0 . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00204))_
- It takes two arguments, evaluates them both, and itself evaluates to the value of the right-hand argument. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00206))_
- So, this is a valid function: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00216))_
- - By evaluating a function that doesn't return a value (() => {})() , and; — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00232))_
- There's a third way, with JavaScript's void operator. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00234))_
- Back to our function. We evaluated this: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00239))_
- Something like: { statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3 ; ... — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00244))_
- So how do we get a function that evaluates a block to return a value when applied? With the return keyword and any expression: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00255))_
- Some languages simplify this by making everything an expression, but JavaScript maintains this distinction, so when learning JavaScript we also learn about statements like function declarations, for loops, if statements, and so forth. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00263))_
- We'll see a few more of these later. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00263))_
- Secondary school mathematics discusses this. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00278))_
- Use them in the body, of course. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00283))_
- It's a function for calculating the circumference of a circle given the diameter. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00285))_
- To apply a function with an argument (or arguments), we put the argument (or arguments) within the parentheses, like this: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00286))_
- 22 The Argument Sketch from 'Monty Python's Previous Record' and 'Monty Python's Instant Record Collection' — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00289))_
- A return statement accepts any valid JavaScript expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00294))_
- Arguments and variables work the same way whether we're talking about (x) => (y) => x or just plain (x) => x . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00308))_
- - JavaScript parses this whole thing as an expression made up of several sub-expressions. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00314))_
- - One sub-expression, (x) => x evaluates to a function. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00316))_
- - Another, 2 , evaluates to the number 2. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00317))_
- - JavaScript now evaluates applying the function to the argument 2 . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00318))_
- And with that, we're ready to look at closures . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00332))_
- NaN in JavaScript behaves a lot like NULL in SQL. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00334))_
- Given ( some function )( some argument ) , we know that we apply the function to the argument, create an environment, bind the value of the argument to the name, and evaluate the function's expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00338))_
- The environment belonging to the function with signature (x) => ... — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00340))_
- Now let's enjoy a relaxed Allongé before we continue! — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00347))_
- has a free variable, but the entire expression refers to (x) => ... — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00354))_
- But before we do so, there's one final question: Where does the ancestry start? If there's no other code in a file, what is (x) => x 's parent environment? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00384))_
- Create an environment for them, of course. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00386))_
- Sometimes, programmers wish to avoid this. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00386))_
- The effect is to insert a new, empty environment in between the global environment and your own functions: {x: 1, '..': {'..': global environment }} . As we'll see when we discuss mutable state, this helps to prevent programmers from accidentally changing the global state that is shared by all code  — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00388))_
- What do we put inside our new function that binds 3.14159265 to the name PI when evaluated? Our circumference function, of course: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00395))_
- Every time we invoke the outer function, we'll invoke the inner function. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00415))_
- And we could use it like this: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00422))_
- Even better, it puts the symbol (like PI ) close to the value ( 3.14159265 ). — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00427))_
- The const keyword introduces one or more bindings in the block that encloses it. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00427))_
- It doesn't incur the cost of a function invocation. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00427))_
- It works just as we want. Instead of: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00429))_
- That emphasizes one of the things JavaScript gets really, really right: Functions as 'first class entities. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00438))_
- For readability, most people put one binding per line: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00439))_
- Let's back up and reconsider how closures work. What happens if we use parameters to bind two different values to the same name? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00454))_
- And we know that functions create environments. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00469))_
- Now we bind 3 to PI in an otherwise empty IIFE inside of our IIFE that binds 3.14159265 to PI . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00480))_
- We say that when we bind a variable using a parameter inside another binding, the inner binding shadows the outer binding. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00482))_
- So what about const . Does it work the same way? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00483))_
- Yes, names bound with const shadow enclosing bindings just like parameters. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00485))_
- That's why we made all these IIFEs. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00486))_
- Ah! const statements don't just shadow values bound within the environments created by functions, they shadow values bound within environments created by blocks! — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00489))_
- Let's get right to it. This code does not name a function: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00504))_
- - We introduce a function with the function keyword. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00514))_
- This still does not name a function, but as we noted above, functions written with the function keyword have an optional 'something else.' Could that 'something else' name a function? Yes, of course. 33 — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00523))_
- As we've seen, JavaScript functions take values as arguments and return values. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00562))_
- But before we go on, we'll talk about some specific types of higher-order functions. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00565))_
- Higher-order functions dominate JavaScript Allongé . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00565))_
- Let's start with a useful combinator: Most programmers call it Compose , although the logicians call it the B combinator or 'Bluebird.' Here is the typical 37 programming implementation: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00573))_
- You'll find lots more perusing the recipes in this book. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00575))_
- You'll see other function decorators in the recipes, like once and maybe. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00589))_
- When you look at functions within functions in JavaScript, there's a bit of a 'spaghetti code' look to it. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00591))_
- We don't want to fool around writing _. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00605))_
- We'll discuss mapWith again. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00610))_
- Wegeneralized composition with the compose combinator. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00616))_
- Although arguments looks like an array, it isn't an array: It's more like an object 43 that happens to bind some values to properties with names that look like integers starting with zero: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00623))_
- 43 We'll look at arrays and plain old javascript objects in depth later. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00627))_
- It's the same idea, after all. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00642))_
- Now our inner function binds arguments[0] every time it is invoked, so we get the same result as if we'd written function (column) { return column * column } . — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00644))_
- - Expression bodies evaluate to the value of the expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00657))_
- - Function application creates a scope. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00661))_
- You'll find examples in Lemonad 45 from Michael Fogus, Functional JavaScript 46 from Oliver Steele and the terse but handy node-ap 47 from James Halliday. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00671))_
- 'Unary' is a function decorator that modifies the number of arguments a function takes: Unary takes any function and turns it into a function taking exactly one argument. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00680))_
- JavaScript's map actually calls each function with three arguments: The element, the index of the element in the array, and the array itself. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00683))_
- However, that's not the whole story. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00683))_
- In that example, it looks exactly like the mapping function you'll find in most languages: You pass it a function, and it calls the function with one argument, the element of the array. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00683))_
- It takes an optional radix argument. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00688))_
- tap('espresso')((it) => { console.log(`Our drink is ' ${ it } '`) }); //=> Our drink is 'espresso' 'espresso' It's easy to turn off: tap('espresso')(); //=> 'espresso' Libraries like Underscore 49 use a version of tap that is 'uncurried:' _.tap('espresso', (it) => console.log(`Our drink is ' ${ it } — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00700))_
- It's also useful for working with object and instance methods. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00705))_
- As a bonus, maybe plays very nicely with instance methods, we'll discuss those later: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00719))_
- You pass it a function, and you get a function back. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00725))_
- 53 Another history lesson. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00740))_
- We've seen operators that act on numeric values, like + and % . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00765))_
- is a unary prefix operator that negates its argument. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00771))_
- , && , and || , but we've said nothing about expressions or about passing other values. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00775))_
- We'll look at those presently. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00775))_
- We'll look at them in a moment, but first, we'll look at one more operator. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00779))_
- 54 We will not discuss JavaScript's numeric behaviour in much depth in this book, but the most important thing to know is that it implements the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754), a technical standard for floating-point computation established in 1985 by the Institute of Electri — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00781))_
- Our logical operators ! — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00789))_
- is the way we write 'is truthy' in JavaScript. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00792))_
- - && evaluates its left-hand expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00794))_
- -If its left-hand expression evaluates to something falsy, && returns the value of its lefthand expression without evaluating its right-hand expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00795))_
- -If its left-hand expression evaluates to something truthy, && evaluates its right-hand expression and returns the value of the right-hand expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00796))_
- - || evaluates its left-hand expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00797))_
- -If its left-hand expression evaluates to something truthy, || returns the value of its lefthand expression without evaluating its right-hand expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00798))_
- -If its left-hand expression evaluates to something false, || evaluates its right-hand expression and returns the value of the right-hand expression. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00799))_
- In JavaScript, && and || aren't boolean logical operators in the logical sense. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00802))_
- If n === 0 , JavaScript does not evaluate (n !== 1 && even(n -2)) . This is very important! Imagine that JavaScript evaluated both sides of the || operator before determining its value. n === 0 would be true. What about (n !== 1 && even(n -2)) ? Well, it would evaluate even(n 2) , or even(-2) — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00808))_
- and so on and so forth until JavaScript throws up its hands and runs out of stack space. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00809))_
- But that's not what happens. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00810))_
- It's best to think of || and && as control-flow operators. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00811))_
- This leads to the infinite recursion we fear. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00815))_
- We saw how to construct an array literal using [ , expressions, , and ] . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00852))_
- to place the elements of an array inside another array. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00872))_
- It acts like destructuring. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00890))_
- It looks like destructuring. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00890))_
- Gathering works with parameters! — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00892))_
- We gather the rest of the parameters. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00893))_
- First, we pick what we call a terminal case . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00911))_
- But we don't know the length of rest . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00913))_
- 'Recursion' sometimes seems like an elaborate party trick. There's even a joke about this: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00918))_
- They find a bunsen burner, a sparker, a tap, an empty beaker, a stand, and a card with the instructions 'boil water.' — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00919))_
- The engineers light the burner immediately. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00921))_
- Recursive algorithms follow the 'divide and conquer' strategy for solving a problem: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00922))_
- We already know how to divide arrays into smaller pieces. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00929))_
- Wecanwrite it out using a ternary operator. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00945))_
- With the exception of the length example at the beginning, our examples so far all involve rebuilding a solution using spreads. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00948))_
- - Given the terminal case of an empty list, we return a 0 instead of an empty list, and; — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00951))_
- - We catenate the square of each element to the result of applying sumSquares to the rest of the elements. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00952))_
- Let's look at how. Here's our extremely simple mapWith function again: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00967))_
- The first two don't return anything, they don't matter. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00982))_
- But while we're doing that, it's annoying to remember to call it with a zero. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00992))_
- This lengthDelaysWork function calls itself in tail position. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-00992))_
- Wesawearlier that destructuring parameters works the same way as destructuring assignment. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01023))_
- Much slower than the built-in .map method for arrays. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01030))_
- Every time we call mapWith , we're calling [...prepend, fn(first)] . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01031))_
- Worse, the JavaScript Engine actually copies the elements from prepend into the new array one at a time. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01032))_
- So here's a question: If this is such a slow approach, why do some examples of 'functional' algorithms work this exact way? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01036))_
- Notice that though JavaScript displays our list as if it is composed of arrays nested within each other like Russian Dolls, in reality the arrays refer to each other with references, so [1,[2,[3,[4,[5,null]]]]] is actually more like: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01054))_
- But what about the rest of the list? cdr does the trick: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01059))_
- Again, it's just extracting a reference from a cons cell, it's very fast. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01061))_
- In Lisp, it's blazingly fast because it happens in hardware. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01061))_
- Getting back to JavaScript now, when we write [first, ...rest] to gather or spread arrays, we're emulating the semantics of car and cdr , but not the implementation. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01063))_
- If [first, ...rest] is so slow, why does JavaScript use arrays instead of making everything a linked list? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01068))_
- In addition to the extra fetches to dereference pointers, pointer chasing suffers from cache misses. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01069))_
- Well, well, well. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01128))_
- Our mapWith function takes twice as long as a straight iteration, because it iterates over the entire list twice, once to map, and once to reverse the list. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01130))_
- Their identities stay the same, but not their structure. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01134))_
- JavaScript permits the reassignment of new values to existing bindings, as well as the reassignment and assignment of new values to elements of containers such as arrays and objects. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01150))_
- Languages like Haskell 70 don't permit mutation at all. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01153))_
- of a list: We aren't making a new list, we're using some of the old list. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01158))_
- In general, it's easier to reason about data that doesn't change. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01162))_
- So back to avoiding mutation. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01162))_
- We took the time to carefully examine what happens with bindings in environments. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01181))_
- However, if we don't shadow age with let , reassigning within the block changes the original: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01187))_
- It then rebinds the name in that environment. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01189))_
- If you buy that argument, the way that shadowing works in JavaScript exists to protect us from accidentally shadowing a variable when we move code around. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01191))_
- Some programmers dislike deliberately shadowing variables. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01191))_
- Well, parameters bind names. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01200))_
- Named function expressions bind names. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01200))_
- So that's five different ways so far. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01200))_
- Function declarations bind names. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01200))_
- It's just different enough to present a source of confusion. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01202))_
- But of course, it's not exactly like let . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01202))_
- JavaScript hoists the declaration, but not the assignment. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01209))_
- It looks a lot like the for loop in C. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01214))_
- So far, so good. Hey, remember that functions in JavaScript are values? Let's get fancy! — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01220))_
- Again, so far, so good. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01222))_
- That's not what we want at all. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01226))_
- Now we're creating a new inner parameter, i and binding it to the value of the outer i . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01231))_
- And therefore, modifications to the parent also modify the child, and modifications to the child also modify the parent. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01239))_
- So back to the problem of structure sharing. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01249))_
- There's also a bug: What happens when we modify the first element of a list? But before we fix that, let's try being lazy about copying. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01253))_
- In case we modify a child list. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01255))_
- I'm not particularly surprised that I couldn't think up an answer in a few minutes at the time. And to the interviewer's credit, he didn't terminate the interview on the spot, he asked me to describe the kinds of things going through my head. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01269))_
- I then forgot about it for a while. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01271))_
- I sent him an email sharing my result, to demonstrate my ability to follow through. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01271))_
- At the time, I couldn't think of any way to use hashing to solve the problem, so I gave up and tried to fit this into a powers-of-two algorithm. My first pass at it was clumsy, but it was roughly equivalent to this: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01276))_
- In Functional Iterators, we'll investigate one pattern for separating these concerns. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01279))_
- As we saw earlier, this entangles the mechanism of traversing the array with the business of summing the bits. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01284))_
- What happens when we want to sum a tree of numbers? Or a linked list of numbers? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01287))_
- Once again, we're mixing the code for iterating over an array with the code for calculating a sum. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01298))_
- We haven't written anything that finds the first element of an iteration that meets a certain criteria. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01327))_
- So as you traverse the new decorator, you're changing the state of the original! — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01333))_
- To Mock a Mockingbird 76 established the metaphor of songbirds for the combinators, and ever since then logicians have called the K combinator a 'kestrel,' the B combinator a 'bluebird,' and so forth. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01341))_
- Let's start with some of the building blocks of combinatory logic, the K, I, and V combinators, nicknamed the 'Kestrel', the 'Idiot Bird', and the 'Vireo:' — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01343))_
- Very simple, but useful. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01351))_
- Now we'll take it one more step forward: Passing a value to K gets a function back, and passing a value to that function gets us a value. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01351))_
- You pass the data to these functions, and they extract it. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01368))_
- You call them and pass them the bits, and they choose what to return. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01369))_
- But the first and second we built out of K and I don't work that way. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01369))_
- And instead of passing latin to first or second , we pass first or second to latin . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01372))_
- It's exactly backwards of the way we write functions that operate on data. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01372))_
- If we change the names to x , y , and z , we get: (x) => (y) => (z) => z(x)(y) . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01381))_
- We'd better try it out to check. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01385))_
- Without arrays, and without objects, just with functions. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01385))_
- But without building our way up to something insane like writing a JavaScript interpreter using JavaScript functions and no other data structures, let's take things another step in a slightly different direction. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01396))_
- Instead of writing length(list) and examining a list, we'll write something like: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01402))_
- Deeply important, but not practical when you're building a bridge. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01415))_
- It's the QED of physics that underpins the Maxwell's Equations of programming. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01415))_
- So what is interesting about this? What nags at our brain as we're falling asleep after working our way through this? — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01419))_
- The same thing happens with our lists. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01426))_
- We won't bother here, but it's easy to see how to swap our functions out and replace them with an array. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01429))_
- The line node === EMPTY presumes a lot of things. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01431))_
- - And instead of testing some property of an entity and making a choice of our own with ?: (or if ), pass the entity the work we want done for each case and let it test itself. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01435))_
- This recipe isn't for map : It's for mapWith , a function that wraps around map and turns any other function into a mapper. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01445))_
- It reverses the arguments, taking the function first and the list second. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01447))_
- mapWith differs from map in two ways. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01447))_
- It also 'curries' the function: Instead of taking two arguments, it takes one argument and returns a function that takes another argument. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01447))_
- It's the same idea, after all. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01451))_
- Both patterns take us to the same destination: Composing functions out of common pieces, rather than building them entirely from scratch. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01455))_
- Looking at this, we see we're conflating two separate transformations. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01463))_
- First, we're reversing the order of arguments. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01463))_
- Second, we're 'currying' the function so that instead of defining a function that takes two arguments, it returns a function that takes the first argument and returns a function that takes the second argument and applies them both, like this: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01465))_
- Let's return to the implementation of mapWith that relies on a map function rather than a method: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01467))_
- Assigning properties from one object to another (also called 'cloning' or 'shallow copying') is a basic building block that we will later use to implement more advanced paradigms like mixins. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01497))_
- Use it as an excuse to get familiar with your environment's debugging facility. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01503))_

- Sometimes you just want to move the box around. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01537))_
- Things like 'put a label on every bag of coffee in this box,' Or, 'Open the box, take out the bags of decaf, and make a new box with just the decaf.' Or, 'go through the bags in this box, and take out the first one marked 'Espresso' that contains at least 454 grams of beans.' — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01538))_
- The way we've written .iterator as a method, each object knows how to return an iterator for itself. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01544))_
- We just ask the object for an iterator, and work on the iterator. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01552))_
- And there's one more thing: You recall that the spread operator ( ... — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01573))_
- It's the same idea, after all. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01597))_
- We invoke mapWith((x) => 2 * x, Numbers) and get Evens . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01602))_
- So we call it a collection operation . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01605))_
- The Numbers iterable returns an object that updates a mutable variable, n , to deliver number after number. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01637))_
- Then it waits for the next request. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01638))_
- Well, we've written our iterator as a server . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01638))_
- It waits until given a request, and then it returns exactly one item. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01638))_
- They're of approximately equal complexity. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01643))_
- Now for the iteration version. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01648))_
- We'll write a functional iterator to keep things simple, but it's easy to see the shape of the basic problem: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01648))_
- Not a fat arrow. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01671))_

- When we invoke empty , we get an iterator with no elements. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01675))_
- It yields the value of something , and then it's done. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01683))_
- - We call oneTwoThree() and get an iterator. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01688))_
- - The iterator suspends its execution . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01692))_

- - The iterator returns {done: true} from the call to .next() , and every call to this iterator's .next() method will return {done: true} from now on. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01707))_
- When the consumer calls .next() , it 'suspends' and the producer starts running. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01710))_
- When the producer yields a value, the producer suspends and the consumer starts running, taking the value from the result of calling .next() . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01710))_
- It's a function that returns an iterator when we invoke it. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01716))_
- If we call our generator function more than once, we get new iterators. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01717))_

- Here's a first crack at a function that returns an iterable object for iterating over trees: — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01737))_
- We've gone with the full iterable here, a TreeIterable(iterable) returns an iterable that treats iterable as a tree. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01739))_
- JavaScript handles the recursion for us using its own execution stack. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01743))_
- append iterates over a collection of iterables, one element at a time. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01748))_
- Tucked inside of it is the same three-line idiom for yielding each element of an iterable. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01749))_
- The operations on iterables are tremendously valuable, but let's reiterate why we care: In JavaScript, we build single-responsibility objects, and single-responsibility functions, and we compose these together to build more full-featured objects and algorithms. — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01770))_
- Each collection knew how to map itself ( .map ), how to fold itself ( .reduce ), how to filter itself ( .filter ) and how to find one element within itself ( .find ). — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01772))_

- Both expressions evaluate to 220 . — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01794))_
- But it's still illustrative to dissect something important: Array's .map and .filter methods gather their results into new arrays. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01795))_
- Whereas the .map and .filter methods on Pair work with iterators. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01796))_
- This reduces the memory footprint. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01796))_
- Arrays copy-on-read, so every time we perform a map or filter, we get a new array and perform all the computations. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01805))_
- Balanced against their flexibility, our 'lazy collections' use structure sharing. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01808))_

- And just as companies often pick a problem that gives them broad latitude for discussing alternate approaches and determining that depth of a candidate's experience, The Carpenter liked to sketch out solutions that provided an opportunity to judge the interviewer's experience and provide an easy exc — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01837))_
- For that, we'll map the Game iterable to positions. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01842))_

- Some time later, The Carpenter ran into Bob Plissken at a local technology meet-up. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01865))_
- The Carpenter smiled. 'I forgot about them, it's been a while. So, do They Live?' — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01866))_
- You're essentially calling for the player to clone themselves and call out the directions in parallel.' — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01872))_
- The Carpenter thought about this for a moment. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01873))_
- To save space, we'll ignore rotations and reflections, and we'll model the first player's moves as a stream. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01882))_
- For 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , or 8 , we play 3 and win. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01889))_

- If x plays 4 , we play 7 and win. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01891))_
- Let's use an array. So this: — _unextracted: segment carries subject matter but no structured claim was recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01898))_
- Our statelessNaughtsAndCrosses function pushes the work of tracking the game's state onto us, the player. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01913))_
- We've done almost the exact same thing here with our naughts and crosses game. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01922))_
- We aren't calling our function with moves, it's calling us. — _fragmentary: no subject/predicate region recovered_ _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-8eb13d6b-01926))_
