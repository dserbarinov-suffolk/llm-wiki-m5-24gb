### Served by the Pot: Collections / Summary

- A generator is a function that is defined with function * and uses yield (or yield * ) to generate values. Using a generator instead of writing an iterator object that has a .next() method allows us to write code that can be much simpler for cases like recursive iterations or state patterns. And we don't need to worry about wrapping our values in an object with .done and .value properties. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01729))_
- This is especially useful for making iterables. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01730))_

The thing to note here is that our fibonacci generator has three states: generating 0, generating
1, and generating everything after that. This isn’t a good fit for an iterator, because iterators have
one functional entry point and therefore, we’d have to represent our three states explicitly, perhaps
using a state pattern90:
We’ll keep it simple:
// Iteration
let a, b, state = 0;
const fibonacci = () => {
switch (state) {
case 0:
state = 1;
return a = 0;
case 1:
state = 2;
return b = 1;
case 2:
[a, b] = [b, a + b];
return b
}
};
while (true) {
console.log(fibonacci());

Again, this is not particularly horrendous, but like the recursive example, we’re explicitly greenspun-
ning the natural linear state. In a generator, we write “do this, then this, then this.” In an iterator,
we have to wrap that up and explicitly keep track of what step we’re on.
So we see the same thing: The generation version has state, but it’s implicit in JavaScript’s linear
control flow. Whereas the iteration version must make that state explicit.
javascript’s generators
It would be very nice if we could sometimes write iterators as a .next() method that gets called, and
sometimes write out a generator. Given the title of this chapter, it is not a surprise that JavaScript
makes this possible.
We can write an iterator, but use a generation style of programming. An iterator written in a
generation style is called a generator. To write a generator, we write a function, but we make two
changes:
1. We declare the function using the function * syntax. Not a fat arrow. Not a plain function.
2. We don’t return values or output them to console.log. We “yield” values using the yield
keyword.
When we invoke the function, we get an iterator object back. Let’s start with the degenerate example,
the empty iterator:91
function * empty () {};
empty().next()
//=>
{"done":true}
When we invoke empty, we get an iterator with no elements. This makes sense, because empty never
yields anything. We call its .next() method, but it’s done immediately.
Generator functions can take an argument. Let’s use that to illustrate yield:
91We wrote a generator declaration. We can also write const empty = function * () {} to bind an anonymous generator to the empty keyword,
but we don’t need to do that here.

Now we can use it in a for...of loop, spread it into an array literal, or spread it into a function
invocation, because we have written an iterable that uses a generator to return an iterator from its
[Symbol.iterator] method.

generator methods for objects:
const ThreeNumbers = {
*[Symbol.iterator] () {
yield 1;
yield 2;
yield 3
}
}
This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. Because it’s declared
*[Symbol.iterator], it’s a generator instead of an iterator.
So to summarize, ThreeNumbers is an object that we’ve made iterable, by way of writing a generator
method for [Symbol.iterator].
more generators
Generators can produce infinite streams of values:
const Numbers = {
*[Symbol.iterator] () {
let i = 0;
while (true) {
yield i++;
}
}

console.log(i);

Our OneTwoThree example used implicit state to output the numbers in sequence. Recall that we
wrote Fibonacci using explicit state:
const Fibonacci = {
[Symbol.iterator]: () => {
let a = 0, b = 1, state = 0;
return {
next: () => {
switch (state) {
case 0:
state = 1;
return {value: a};
case 1:
state = 2;
return {value: b};
case 2:
[a, b] = [b, a + b];
return {value: b};
}
}
}
}
};
for (let n of Fibonacci) {
console.log(n)
}

yield* is handy when writing generator functions that operate on or create iterables.
rewriting iterable operations
Now that we know about iterables, we can rewrite our iterable operations as generators. Instead of:
Served by the Pot: Collections
221
const mapWith = (fn, iterable) =>
({
[Symbol.iterator]: () => {
const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
return {
next: () => {
const {done, value} = iterator.next();
return ({done, value: done ? undefined : fn(value)});
}
}
}
});
We can write:
function * mapWith (fn, iterable) {
for (const element of iterable) {
yield fn(element);
}
}
No need to explicitly construct an object that has a [Symbol.iterator] method. No need to return
an object with a .next() method. No need to fool around with {done} or {value}, just yield values
until we’re done.
We can do the same thing with our other operations like filterWith and untilWith. Here’re our
iterable methods rewritten as generators:
function * mapWith(fn, iterable) {
for (const element of iterable) {
yield fn(element);
}
}
function * filterWith (fn, iterable) {
for (const element of iterable) {
if (!!fn(element)) yield element;
}
}
Served by the Pot: Collections
222
function * untilWith (fn, iterable) {
for (const element of iterable) {
if (fn(element)) break;
yield fn(element);
}
}
first works directly with iterators and remains unchanged, but rest can be rewritten as a generator:
const first = (iterable) =>
iterable[Symbol.iterator]().next().value;
function * rest (iterable) {
const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
iterator.next();
yield * iterator;
}
```
