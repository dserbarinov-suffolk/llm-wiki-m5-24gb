# Pattern

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about pattern:

## Statements

### inside-out

- 29 JavaScript programmers regularly use the idea of writing an expression that denotes a function and then immediately applying it to arguments. Explaining the pattern, Ben Alman coined the term [Immediately Invoked Function Expression][iife] for it, often abbreviated 'IIFE.' _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00389))_

### Building Blocks

- When you look at functions within functions in JavaScript, there's a bit of a 'spaghetti code' look to it. The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything. The weakness is that you will. There are ifs, fors, returns, everything thrown higgledy piggledy together. Although you needn't restrict yourself to a small number of simple patterns, it can be helpful to understand the patterns so that you can structure your code around some basic building blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00565))_

### composition

- If that was all there was to it, composition wouldn't matter much. But like many patterns, using it when it applies is only 20% of the benefit. The other 80% comes from organizing your code such that you can use it: Writing functions that can be composed in various ways. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00571))_

### mutation and data structures

- One pattern many people follow is to be liberal with mutation when constructing data, but conservative with mutation when consuming data. Let's recall linked lists from Plain Old JavaScript Objects. While we're executing the mapWith function, we're constructing a new linked list. By this pattern, we would be happy to use mutation to construct the list while running mapWith . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01119))_

### copy-on-write

- Looking at the code again, you see that the copy function doesn't copy on write: It follows the pattern that while constructing something, we own it and can be liberal with mutation. Once we're done with it and give it to someone else, we need to be conservative and use a strategy like copy-on-read or copy-on-write. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01230))_

### operations on ordered collections

- This illustrates the general pattern of working with ordered collections: We make them iterables , meaning that they have a [Symbol.iterator] method, that returns an iterator . An iterator is also an object, but with a .next() method that is invoked repeatedly to obtain the elements in order. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01560))_

### generators and iterables

- This pattern is encouraged, so much so that JavaScript provides a concise syntax for writing generator methods for objects: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01682))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: inside-out

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00391))_

> Everything else is encapsulated in its body. That's how it should be, naming PI is its concern, not ours. The other formulation:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00390))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-c7f7381982c5437e"></a>
```
(diameter) =>
// ...
```

### Technical frame 2: composition

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00572))_

> In the recipes, we'll look at a decorator called once: It ensures that a function can only be executed once. Thereafter, it does nothing. Once is useful for ensuring that certain side effects are not repeated. We'll also look at maybe: It ensures that a function does nothing if it is given nothing (like null or undefined ) as an argument.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00573))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-4f6b1bb5af0460d2"></a>
> Of course, you needn't use combinators to implement either of these ideas, you can use if statements.

### Technical frame 3: generators and iterables

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01684))_

> This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01683))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-54530c82c657b597"></a>
```
const ThreeNumbers = {
*[Symbol.iterator] () {
yield 1;
yield 2;
yield 3
}
}
```
