# Data

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about data:

## Statements

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Self-Similarity

- Let's be more specific. Some data structures, like lists, can obviously be seen as a collection of items. Some are empty, some have three items, some forty-two, some contain numbers, some contain strings, some a mixture of elements, there are all kinds of lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00880))_

### Garbage, Garbage Everywhere / some history

- Thus, CONS put two values together, CAR extracted one, and CDR extracted the other. Lisp's basic data type is often said to be the list, but in actuality it was the 'cons cell,' the term used to describe two 15-bit values stored in one word. The 15-bit values were used as pointers that could refer to a location in memory, so in effect, a cons cell was a little data structure with two pointers to other cons cells. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01027))_

### Copy on Write / Functional Iterators

- What we've done is turn an array into a function that folds an array with const foldArray = (array) => callRight(foldArrayWith, array); . The sumFoldable function doesn't care what kind of data structure we have, as long as it's foldable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01275))_

### Copy on Write / Making Data Out Of Functions / backwardness

- In both cases, the functions first and second know how the data is represented, whether it be an array or an object. You pass the data to these functions, and they extract it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01353))_

- Our latin data structure is no longer a dumb data structure, it's a function. And instead of passing latin to first or second , we pass first or second to latin . It's exactly backwards of the way we write functions that operate on data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01357))_

### Copy on Write / Making Data Out Of Functions / the vireo

- Given that our latin data is represented as the function (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus") , our obvious next step is to make a function that makes data. For arrays, we'd write cons = (first, second) => [first, second] . For objects we'd write: cons = (first, second) => {first, second} . In both cases, we take two parameters, and return the form of the data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01359))_

- For 'data' we access with K and K(I) , our 'structure' is the function (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus") . Let's extract those into parameters: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01360))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: Composing and Decomposing Data / Arrays and Destructuring Arguments / gathering

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00847))_

> Sometimes we need to extract arrays from arrays. Here is the most common pattern: Extracting the head and gathering everything but the head from an array:

### Technical frame 2: Composing and Decomposing Data / Tail Calls (and Default Arguments) / converting non-tail-calls to tail-calls

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00981))_

> Brilliant! We can map over large arrays without incurring all the memory and performance overhead of non-tail-calls. And this basic transformation from a recursive function that does not make a tail call, into a recursive function that calls itself in tail position, is a bread-and-butter pattern for programmers using a language that incorporates tail-call optimization.

### Technical frame 3: Garbage, Garbage Everywhere / some history

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01290))_

> We can write a different iterator for a different data structure. Here's one for linked lists:

const isEmpty = (node) => node === EMPTY;
const pair = (first, rest = EMPTY) => ({first, rest});
const list = (...elements) => {
const [first, ...rest] = elements;
return elements.length === 0
? EMPTY
: pair(first, list(...rest))
}
const print = (aPair) =>
isEmpty(aPair)
? ""
: `${aPair.first} ${print(aPair.rest)}`
const listIterator = (aPair) =>
() => {
const done = isEmpty(aPair);
if (done) {
return {done};
}
else {
const {first, rest} = aPair;
aPair = aPair.rest;

}
}
const iteratorSum = (iterator) => {
let eachIteration,
sum = 0;;
while ((eachIteration = iterator(), !eachIteration.done)) {
sum += eachIteration.value;
}
return sum
}
const aListIterator = listIterator(list(1, 4, 9, 16, 25));
iteratorSum(aListIterator)
//=> 55
```

### Technical frame 6: Copy on Write / Functional Iterators / unfolding and laziness

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01298))_

> A function that starts with a seed and expands it into a data structure is called an unfold . It's the opposite of a fold. It's possible to write a generic unfold mechanism, but let's pass on to what we can do with unfolded iterators.

//=> 2
fromOne().value;
//=> 3
fromOne().value;

### Technical frame 7: Copy on Write / Making Data Out Of Functions

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01326))_

> They established that arbitrary computations could be represented a small set of axiomatic components. For example, we don't need arrays to represent lists, or even POJOs to represent nodes in a linked list. We can model lists just using functions.

### Technical frame 9: Copy on Write / Making Data Out Of Functions / the vireo

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01362))_

> For consistency with the way combinators are written as functions taking just one parameter, we'll curry 78 the function:

### Technical frame 10: Copy on Write / Making Data Out Of Functions / the vireo

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01369))_

> As an aside, the Vireo is a little like JavaScript's .apply function. It says, 'take these two values and apply them to this function.' There are other, similar combinators that apply values to functions. One notable example is the 'thrush' or T combinator: It takes one value and applies it to a function. It is known to most programmers as .tap .

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01400))_

> Knowing how to make a list out of just functions is a little like knowing that photons are the Gauge Bosons 81 of the electromagnetic force. It's the QED of physics that underpins the Maxwell's Equations of programming. Deeply important, but not practical when you're building a bridge.
