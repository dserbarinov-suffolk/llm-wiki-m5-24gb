# Data

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about data:

## Statements

### Self-Similarity

- Let's be more specific. Some data structures, like lists, can obviously be seen as a collection of items. Some are empty, some have three items, some forty-two, some contain numbers, some contain strings, some a mixture of elements, there are all kinds of lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00866))_

### some history

- Thus, CONS put two values together, CAR extracted one, and CDR extracted the other. Lisp's basic data type is often said to be the list, but in actuality it was the 'cons cell,' the term used to describe two 15-bit values stored in one word. The 15-bit values were used as pointers that could refer to a location in memory, so in effect, a cons cell was a little data structure with two pointers to other cons cells. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01011))_

### Functional Iterators

- What we've done is turn an array into a function that folds an array with const foldArray = (array) => callRight(foldArrayWith, array); . The sumFoldable function doesn't care what kind of data structure we have, as long as it's foldable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01255))_

### backwardness

- In both cases, the functions first and second know how the data is represented, whether it be an array or an object. You pass the data to these functions, and they extract it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01332))_

- Our latin data structure is no longer a dumb data structure, it's a function. And instead of passing latin to first or second , we pass first or second to latin . It's exactly backwards of the way we write functions that operate on data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01336))_

### the vireo

- Given that our latin data is represented as the function (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus") , our obvious next step is to make a function that makes data. For arrays, we'd write cons = (first, second) => [first, second] . For objects we'd write: cons = (first, second) => {first, second} . In both cases, we take two parameters, and return the form of the data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01338))_

- For 'data' we access with K and K(I) , our 'structure' is the function (selector) => selector("primus")("secundus") . Let's extract those into parameters: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01339))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: some history

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01023))_

> car is very fast, it simply extracts the first element of the cons cell.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01022))_

```
car(oneToFive)
//=> 1
```

### Technical frame 2: Making Data Out Of Functions

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01305))_

> They established that arbitrary computations could be represented a small set of axiomatic components. For example, we don't need arrays to represent lists, or even POJOs to represent nodes in a linked list. We can model lists just using functions.

const first = ([first, second]) => first,
second = ([first, second]) => second;
const latin = ["primus", "secundus"];
first(latin)
//=> "primus"
second(latin)
//=> "secundus"
```

### Technical frame 4: the vireo

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01341))_

> For consistency with the way combinators are written as functions taking just one parameter, we'll curry 78 the function:

(first, second) => (selector) => selector(first)(second)
```

### Technical frame 5: the vireo

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01348))_

> As an aside, the Vireo is a little like JavaScript's .apply function. It says, 'take these two values and apply them to this function.' There are other, similar combinators that apply values to functions. One notable example is the 'thrush' or T combinator: It takes one value and applies it to a function. It is known to most programmers as .tap .

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01344))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-6e9fd7c9270a7ba7"></a>
```
const first = K,
second = K(I),
pair = (first) => (second) => (selector) => selector(first)(second);
const latin = pair("primus")("secundus");
latin(first)
//=> "primus"
latin(second)
//=> "secundus"
```
