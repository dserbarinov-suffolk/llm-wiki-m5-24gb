# function declaration caveats 34

From [[javascriptallonge]].

## Pattern

- Use the source-backed pattern described in [[javascriptallonge-section-function-declaration-caveats-34-62da382e]].
- Evidence roles: decision, explanation, constraint, procedure, example, structured-state.

## Applicability And Rationale

- Although some JavaScript environments permit the following code, this example is technically illegal and definitely a bad idea: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00533))_
- Function declarations are formally only supposed to be made at what we might call the 'top level' of a function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00533))_
- 34 A number of the caveats discussed here were described in Jyrly Zaytsev's excellent article Named function expressions demystified. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00534))_
- Function declarations are not supposed to occur inside of blocks. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00536))_
- The big trouble with expressions like this is that they may work just fine in your test environment but work a different way in production. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00536))_
- Another caveat is that a function declaration cannot exist inside of any expression, otherwise it's a function expression. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00537))_

## Technical Atoms

### Atom 1: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00535)_

```
(function (camelCase) {
return fizzbuzz();
if (camelCase) {
function fizzbuzz () {
return "Fizz" + "Buzz";
}
}
else {
function fizzbuzz () {
return "Fizz" + "Buzz";
}
}
})(true)
//=> 'FizzBuzz'? Or ERROR: Can't find variable: fizzbuzz?
```

### Atom 2: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00538)_

```
function trueDat () { return true }
But this is not:
(function trueDat () { return true })
```
