# Functional

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about functional:

## Statements

### ECMAScript 6 has three major groups of features: / Forewords to the First Edition / michael fogus

- As a staunch advocate of functional programming, much of what Reg has written rings true to me. While not exclusively a book about functional programming, JavaScript Allongé will provide a solid foundation for functional techniques. However, you'll not be beaten about the head and neck with dogma. Instead, every section is motivated by relevant dialog and fortified with compelling source examples. As an author of programming books I admire what Reg has managed to accomplish and I envy the fine reader who finds JavaScript Allongé via some darkened channel in the Internet sprawl and reads it for the first time. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00089))_

### Reassignment / why const and let were invented

- const and let are recent additions to JavaScript. For nearly twenty years, variables were declared with var (not counting parameters and function declarations, of course). However, its functional scope was a problem. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01197))_

### Served by the Pot: Collections / Generating Iterables

- Let's consider how they work. Whether it's a simple functional iterator, or an iterable object with a .next() method, an iterator is something we call repeatedly until it tells us that it's done. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01621))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: Recipes with Basic Functions / Partial Application

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00655))_

> These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. 48 If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a 'hole' in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. They are context-agnostic.

Partial Application
In Building Blocks, we discussed partial application, but we didn't write a generalized recipe for it. This is such a common tool that many libraries provide some form of partial application. You'll find examples in Lemonad 45 from Michael Fogus, Functional JavaScript 46 from Oliver Steele and the terse but handy node-ap 47 from James Halliday.

### Technical frame 4: Served by the Pot: Collections / Generating Iterables

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01625))_

> Well, we've written our iterator as a server . It waits until given a request, and then it returns exactly one item. Then it waits for the next request. There is no concept of pushing numbers out from the iterator, just waiting until a number is pulled out of the iterator by whatever code consumes numbers.

> Iterators have to arrange its own state such that when you call them, they compute and return the next item.

### Technical frame 5: Served by the Pot: Collections / Generating Iterables / recursive iterators

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01639))_

> If you peel off isIterable and ignore the way that the iteration version uses [Symbol.iterator] and .next , we're left with the fact that the generating version calls itself recursively, and the iteration version maintains an explicit stack. In essence, both the generation and iteration implementations have stacks, but the generation version's stack is implicit , while the iteration version's stack is explicit .

const isIterable = (something) =>
!!something[Symbol.iterator];
const treeIterator = (iterable) => {
const iterators = [ iterable[Symbol.iterator]() ];
return () => {
while (!!iterators[0]) {
const iterationResult = iterators[0].next();
if (iterationResult.done) {
iterators.shift();
}
else if (isIterable(iterationResult.value)) {
iterators.unshift(iterationResult.value[Symbol.iterator]());

> The thing to note here is that our fibonacci generator has three states: generating 0 , generating 1 , and generating everything after that.

The thing to note here is that our fibonacci generator has three states: generating 0, generating
1, and generating everything after that. This isn’t a good fit for an iterator, because iterators have
one functional entry point and therefore, we’d have to represent our three states explicitly, perhaps
using a state pattern90:
We’ll keep it simple:
// Iteration
let a, b, state = 0;
const fibonacci = () => {
switch (state) {
case 0:
state = 1;
return a = 0;
case 1:
state = 2;
return b = 1;
case 2:
[a, b] = [b, a + b];
return b
}
};
while (true) {
console.log(fibonacci());
}
//=>
0

90https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern
Served by the Pot: Collections

55
89
144
...
Again, this is not particularly horrendous, but like the recursive example, we’re explicitly greenspun-
ning the natural linear state. In a generator, we write “do this, then this, then this.” In an iterator,
we have to wrap that up and explicitly keep track of what step we’re on.
So we see the same thing: The generation version has state, but it’s implicit in JavaScript’s linear
control flow. Whereas the iteration version must make that state explicit.
javascript’s generators
It would be very nice if we could sometimes write iterators as a .next() method that gets called, and
sometimes write out a generator. Given the title of this chapter, it is not a surprise that JavaScript
makes this possible.
We can write an iterator, but use a generation style of programming. An iterator written in a
generation style is called a generator. To write a generator, we write a function, but we make two
changes:
1. We declare the function using the function * syntax. Not a fat arrow. Not a plain function.
2. We don’t return values or output them to console.log. We “yield” values using the yield
keyword.
When we invoke the function, we get an iterator object back. Let’s start with the degenerate example,
the empty iterator:91
function * empty () {};
empty().next()
//=>
{"done":true}
When we invoke empty, we get an iterator with no elements. This makes sense, because empty never
yields anything. We call its .next() method, but it’s done immediately.
Generator functions can take an argument. Let’s use that to illustrate yield:
91We wrote a generator declaration. We can also write const empty = function * () {} to bind an anonymous generator to the empty keyword,
but we don’t need to do that here.
