# floating

From [[javascriptallonge]].

## Pattern

- Use the source-backed pattern described in [[javascriptallonge-section-a-rich-aroma-basic-numbers-floating-1170cd1c]].
- Evidence roles: decision, constraint, explanation, example, structured-state.

## Applicability And Rationale

- But we mentioned that numbers are represented internally as floating point, meaning that they need not be just integers. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00143))_
- We can, for example, write 1.5 or 33.33 , and JavaScript represents these literals as floating point numbers. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00143))_
- Most programmers never encounter the limit on the magnitude of an integer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00143))_
- It's tempting to think we now have everything we need to do things like handle amounts of money, but as the late John Belushi would say, 'Nooooooooooooooooooooo.' A computer's internal representation for a floating point number is binary, while our literal number was in base ten. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00144))_
- This makes no meaningful difference for integers, but it does for fractions, because some fractions base 10 do not have exact representations base 2. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00144))_
- But as a rule, if you need to work with real numbers, you should have more than a nodding acquaintance with the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic 15 . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00151))_

## Technical Atoms

### Atom 1: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00146)_

```
1.0
//=> 1
1.0 + 1.0
//=> 2
1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0
//=> 3
```

### Atom 2: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00149)_

```
0.1
//=> 0.1
0.1 + 0.1
//=> 0.2
0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
//=> 0.30000000000000004
```

### Atom 3: `worked-example`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00150)_

```
This kind of 'inexactitude' can be ignored when performing calculations that have an acceptable deviation. For example, when centering some text on a page, as long as the difference between what you might calculate longhand and JavaScript's calculation is less than a pixel, there is no observable error.
```
