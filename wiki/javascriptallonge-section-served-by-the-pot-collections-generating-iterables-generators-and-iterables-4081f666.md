## Statements

- Our generator function oneTwoThree is not an iterator. It's a function that returns an iterator when we invoke it. We write the function to yield values instead of return a single value, and JavaScript takes care of turning this into an object with a .next() function we can call. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01704))_
- If we call our generator function more than once, we get new iterators. As we saw above, we called oneTwoThree three times, and each time we got an iterator that begins at 1 and counts to 3 . Recalling the way we wrote ordered collections, we could make a collection that uses a generator function: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01705))_
- This pattern is encouraged, so much so that JavaScript provides a concise syntax for writing generator methods for objects: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01708))_
- This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01710))_
- Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01710))_

const iterator = ThreeNumbers[Symbol.iterator]();

{"done":false, value: 2}

{"done":true}
Now we can use it in a for...of loop, spread it into an array literal, or spread it into a function
invocation, because we have written an iterable that uses a generator to return an iterator from its
[Symbol.iterator] method.

generator methods for objects:
const ThreeNumbers = {
*[Symbol.iterator] () {
yield 1;
yield 2;
yield 3
}
}
This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. Because it’s declared
*[Symbol.iterator], it’s a generator instead of an iterator.
So to summarize, ThreeNumbers is an object that we’ve made iterable, by way of writing a generator
method for [Symbol.iterator].

Generators can produce infinite streams of values:
const Numbers = {
*[Symbol.iterator] () {
let i = 0;
while (true) {
yield i++;
}
}
};
for (const i of Numbers) {
console.log(i);
}

Our OneTwoThree example used implicit state to output the numbers in sequence. Recall that we
wrote Fibonacci using explicit state:
const Fibonacci = {
[Symbol.iterator]: () => {
let a = 0, b = 1, state = 0;
return {
next: () => {
switch (state) {
case 0:
state = 1;
return {value: a};
case 1:
state = 2;
return {value: b};
case 2:
[a, b] = [b, a + b];
return {value: b};
}
}
}
}
};
for (let n of Fibonacci) {
console.log(n)
}
```
