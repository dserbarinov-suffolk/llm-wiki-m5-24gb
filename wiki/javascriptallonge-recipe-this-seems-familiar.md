# this seems familiar

From [[javascriptallonge]].

## Pattern

- Use the source-backed pattern described in [[javascriptallonge-section-this-seems-familiar-42bba055]].
- Evidence roles: decision, constraint, explanation, procedure, example.

## Applicability And Rationale

- Sometimes there is a state machine that is naturally represented implicitly in JavaScript's control flow rather than explicitly in data. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01882))_
- When we looked at generators, we saw that some iterators are inherently stateful, but sometimes it is awkward to represent them in a fully stateless fashion. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01882))_
- A game like this is absolutely a state machine, and we've explicitly coded those states into the lookup table. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01883))_
- If we were in full control of the interaction, it would be easy to encode the game play as a decision tree instead of as a lookup table. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01884))_
- Naughts and crosses is simple enough that the lookup function seems substantially simpler, in part because linear code doesn't represent trees particularly well. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01886))_
- But we can clearly see that if we wanted to, we could represent the state of the program implicitly in a decision tree. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01886))_

## Technical Atoms

### Atom 1: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01885)_

```
function browserNaughtsAndCrosses () {
const x1 = parseInt(prompt('o plays 0, where does x play?'));
switch (x1) {
case 1:
const x2 = parseInt(prompt('o plays 6, where does x play?'));
switch (x2) {
case 2:
case 4:
case 5:
case 7:
case 8:
alert('o plays 3');
break;
case 3:
const x3 = parseInt(prompt('o plays 8, where does x play?'));
switch (x3) {
case 2:
case 5:
case 7:
alert('o plays 4');
break;
case 4:
alert('o plays 7');
break;
}
}
break;
// ...
}
}
```
