## Statements

- To make pairs work, we did things backwards , we passed the first and rest functions to the pair, and the pair called our function. As it happened, the pair was composed by the vireo (or V combinator): (x) => (y) => (z) => z(x)(y) . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01404))_
- But we could have done something completely different. We could have written a pair that stored its elements in an array, or a pair that stored its elements in a POJO. All we know is that we can pass the pair function a function of our own, at it will be called with the elements of the pair. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01405))_
- The exact implementation of a pair is hidden from the code that uses a pair. Here, we'll prove it: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01406))_
- This is a little gratuitous, but it makes the point: The code that uses the data doesn't reach in and touch it: The code that uses the data provides some code and asks the data to do something with it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01408))_
- We're passing list what we want done with an empty list, and what we want done with a list that has at least one element. We then ask list to do it, and provide a way for list to call the code we pass in. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01411))_
- The line node === EMPTY presumes a lot of things. It presumes there is one canonical empty list value. It presumes you can compare these things with the === operator. We can fix this with an isEmpty function, but now we're pushing even more knowledge about the structure of lists into the code that uses them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01414))_
- Having a list know itself whether it is empty hides implementation information from the code that uses lists. This is a fundamental principle of good design. It is a tenet of Object-Oriented Programming, but it is not exclusive to OOP: We can and should design data structures to hide implementation information from the code that use them, whether we are working with functions, objects, or both. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01415))_
- There are many tools for hiding implementation information, and we have now seen two particularly powerful patterns: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01416))_
- Instead of directly manipulating part of an entity, pass it a function and have it call our function with the part we want. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01417))_
- We then ask list to do it, and provide a way for list to call the code we pass in. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01411))_
