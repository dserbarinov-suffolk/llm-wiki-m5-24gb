## Statements

- Well, linked lists are fast for a few things, like taking the front element off a list, and taking the remainder of a list. But not for iterating over a list: Pointer chasing through memory is quite a bit slower than incrementing an index. In addition to the extra fetches to dereference pointers, pointer chasing suffers from cache misses. And if you want an arbitrary item from a list, you have to iterate through the list element by element, whereas with the indexed array you just fetch it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01034))_
- We have avoided discussing rebinding and mutating values, but if we want to change elements of our lists, the naïve linked list implementation suffers as well: When we take the cdr of a linked list, we are sharing the elements. If we make any change other than cons-ing a new element to the front, we are changing both the new list and the old list. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01035))_
- Arrays avoid this problem by pessimistically copying all the references whenever we extract an element or sequence of elements from them (We'll see this explained later in Mutation). _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01036))_
- For these and other reasons, almost all languages today make it possible to use a fast array or vector type that is optimized for iteration, and even Lisp now has a variety of data structures that are optimized for specific use cases. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01037))_
