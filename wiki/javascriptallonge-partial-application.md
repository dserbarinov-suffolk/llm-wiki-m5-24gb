# partial application

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about partial application:

## Statements

### And also: / Closures and Scope / it's always the environment

- The first function is the result of currying a the second function. Calling a curried function with only some of its arguments is sometimes called partial application b . Some programming languages automatically curry and partially evaluate functions without the need to manually nest them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00361))_

### And also: / Building Blocks / partial application

- Another basic building block is partial application . When a function takes multiple arguments, we 'apply' the function to the arguments by evaluating it with all of the arguments, producing a value. But what if we only supply some of the arguments? In that case, we can't get the final value, but we can get a function that represents part of our application. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00586))_

- Code is easier than words for this. The Underscore 39 library provides a higher-order function called map . 40 It applies another function to each element of an array, like this: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00587))_

- The resulting functionsquareAll -is still the map function, it's just that we've applied one of its two arguments already. squareAll is nice, but why write one function every time we want to partially apply a function to a map? We can abstract this one level higher. mapWith takes any function as an argument and returns a partially applied map function. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00592))_

- We'll discuss mapWith again. The important thing to see is that partial application is orthogonal to composition, and that they both work together nicely: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00594))_

- Wegeneralized composition with the compose combinator. Partial application also has a combinator, which we'll see in the partial recipe. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00598))_

### And also: / Magic Names / the function keyword

- The most common use of the arguments binding is to build functions that can take a variable number of arguments. We'll see it used in many of the recipes, starting off with partial application and ellipses. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00612))_

### Recipes with Basic Functions / Partial Application

- These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. 48 If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a 'hole' in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. They are context-agnostic. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00655))_

- As noted above, our partial recipe allows us to create functions that are partial applications of functions that are context aware. We'd need a different recipe if we wish to create partial applications of object methods. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00657))_

- We take it a step further, and can use gathering and spreading to allow for partial application with more than one argument: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00660))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / factorials

- Asbefore, we wrote a factorialWithDelayedWork function, then used partial application ( callLast ) to make a factorial function that took just the one argument and supplied the initial work value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00994))_

39 http://underscorejs.org
41 If we don't want to sort out Underscore, we can also write the following: const map = (a, fn) => a.map(fn); , and trust that it works even though we haven't discussed methods yet.
40 Modern JavaScript implementations provide a map method for arrays, but Underscore's implementation also works with older browsers if you are working with that headache.

Partial Application
In Building Blocks, we discussed partial application, but we didn't write a generalized recipe for it. This is such a common tool that many libraries provide some form of partial application. You'll find examples in Lemonad 45 from Michael Fogus, Functional JavaScript 46 from Oliver Steele and the terse but handy node-ap 47 from James Halliday.
