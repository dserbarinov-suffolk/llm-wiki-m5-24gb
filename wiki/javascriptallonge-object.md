# Object

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about object:

## Statements

### Plain Old JavaScript Objects

- In JavaScript, an object is a map from string keys to values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01049))_

### literal object syntax

- Two objects created with separate evaluations have differing identities, just like arrays: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01054))_

### Mutation

- In JavaScript, almost every type of value can mutate . Their identities stay the same, but not their structure. Specifically, arrays and objects can mutate. Recall that you can access a value from within an array or an object using [] . You can reassign a value using [] = : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01099))_

- JavaScript permits the reassignment of new values to existing bindings, as well as the reassignment and assignment of new values to elements of containers such as arrays and objects. Mutating existing objects has special implications when two bindings are aliases of the same value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01115))_

### Iteration and Iterables

- Many objects in JavaScript can model collections of things. A collection is like a box containing stuff. Sometimes you just want to move the box around. But sometimes you want to open it up and do things with its contents. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01498))_

### iterator objects

- Iteration for functions and objects has been around for many, many decades. For simple linear collections like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, functional iterators are the simplest and easiest way to implement iterators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01516))_

- In programs involving large collections of objects, it can be handy to implement iterators as objects, rather than functions. The mechanics of iterating can then be factored using the same tools that are used to factor the mechanics of all other objects in the system. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01517))_

- Fortunately, an iterator object is almost as simple as an iterator function. Instead of having a function that you call to get the next element, you have an object with a .next() method. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01518))_

### Like this:

- Now our .iterator() method is returning an iterator object. When working with objects, we do things the object way. But having started by building functional iterators, we understand what is happening underneath the object's scaffolding. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01522))_

### iterables

- The expression Symbol.iterator evaluates to a special symbol representing the name of the method that objects should use if they return an iterator object. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01527))_

- The for...of loop works directly with any object that is iterable , meaning it works with any object that has a Symbol.iterator method that returns an object iterator. Here's another linked list, this one is iterable: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01532))_

### Generating Iterables

- Let's consider how they work. Whether it's a simple functional iterator, or an iterable object with a .next() method, an iterator is something we call repeatedly until it tells us that it's done. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01595))_

### generators and iterables

- Our generator function oneTwoThree is not an iterator. It's a function that returns an iterator when we invoke it. We write the function to yield values instead of return a single value, and JavaScript takes care of turning this into an object with a .next() function we can call. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01678))_

- This object declares a [Symbol.iterator] function that makes it iterable. Because it's declared *[Symbol.iterator] , it's a generator instead of an iterator. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01684))_

### Summary

- A generator is a function that is defined with function * and uses yield (or yield * ) to generate values. Using a generator instead of writing an iterator object that has a .next() method allows us to write code that can be much simpler for cases like recursive iterations or state patterns. And we don't need to worry about wrapping our values in an object with .done and .value properties. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01729))_

### Lazy and Eager Collections

- in the older style of object-oriented programming, we built 'fat' objects. Each collection knew how to map itself ( .map ), how to fold itself ( .reduce ), how to filter itself ( .filter ) and how to find one element within itself ( .find ). If we wanted to flatten collections to arrays, we wrote a .toArray method for each type of collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01734))_

- This 'fat object' style springs from a misunderstanding: When we say a collection should know how to perform a map over itself, we don't need for the collection to handle every single detail. That would be like saying that when we ask a bank teller for some cash, they personally print every bank note. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01737))_

### implementing methods with iteration

- Object-oriented collections should definitely have methods for mapping, reducing, filtering, and finding. And they should know how to accomplish the desired result, but they should do so by delegating as much of the work as possible to operations like mapWith . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01739))_

### lazy collection operations

- Whereas the .map and .filter methods on Pair work with iterators. They produce small iterable objects that refer back to the original iteration. This reduces the memory footprint. When working with very large collections and many operations, this can be important. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01758))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: the function keyword

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00602))_

> The most common use of the arguments binding is to build functions that can take a variable number of arguments. We'll see it used in many of the recipes, starting off with partial application and ellipses.

{ year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 }
```

### Technical frame 3: literal object syntax

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01056))_

> Values contained within an object work just like values contained within an array, we access them by reference to the original:

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01055))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-658448541f1bab12"></a>
```
{ year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 } === { year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 }
//=> false
Objects use [] to access the values by name, using a string:
{ year: 2012, month: 6, day: 14 }['day']
//=> 14
```

### Technical frame 4: literal object syntax

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01058))_

> Names needn't be alphanumeric strings. For anything else, enclose the label in quotes:

const unique = () => [],
x = unique(),
y = unique(),
z = unique(),
o = { a: x, b: y, c: z };
o['a'] === x && o['b'] === y && o['c'] === z
//=> true
```

### Technical frame 5: literal object syntax

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01072))_

> (There are some other technical differences between binding a named function expression and using compact method syntax, but they are not relevant here. We will generally prefer compact method syntax whenever we can.)

```
const oneTwoThree = [1, 2, 3];
oneTwoThree[0] = 'one';
oneTwoThree
//=> [ 'one', 2, 3 ]
```

### Technical frame 7: Mutation

name.middleName = 'Austin'
name

```

### Technical frame 8: iterables

const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();
let eachIteration,
sum = 0;
while ((eachIteration = iterator.next(), !eachIteration.done)) {
sum += eachIteration.value;
}
return sum
}
collectionSum(stack)
//=> 2015
Using [Symbol.iterator] instead of .iterator seems like adding an extra moving part for nothing.
Do we get anything in return?
Indeed we do. Behold the for...of loop:
const iterableSum = (iterable) => {
let sum = 0;
for (const num of iterable) {
sum += num;
}
return sum
}
iterableSum(stack)
//=> 2015

const list = (...elements) => {

const someSquares = list(1, 4, 9, 16, 25);
iterableSum(someSquares)
//=> 55

### Technical frame 11: Generating Iterables

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01599))_

> Well, we've written our iterator as a server . It waits until given a request, and then it returns exactly one item. Then it waits for the next request. There is no concept of pushing numbers out from the iterator, just waiting until a number is pulled out of the iterator by whatever code consumes numbers.
