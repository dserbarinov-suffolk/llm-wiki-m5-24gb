## Statements

- These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. 48 If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a 'hole' in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. They are context-agnostic. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00655))_
- As noted above, our partial recipe allows us to create functions that are partial applications of functions that are context aware. We'd need a different recipe if we wish to create partial applications of object methods. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00657))_
- We take it a step further, and can use gathering and spreading to allow for partial application with more than one argument: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00660))_

Partial Application
In Building Blocks, we discussed partial application, but we didn't write a generalized recipe for it. This is such a common tool that many libraries provide some form of partial application. You'll find examples in Lemonad 45 from Michael Fogus, Functional JavaScript 46 from Oliver Steele and the terse but handy node-ap 47 from James Halliday.
