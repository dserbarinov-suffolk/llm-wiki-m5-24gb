# Functional Iterators

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about functional iterators:

## Statements

### Functional Iterators

- The nice thing about this is that the definition for arraySum mostly concerns itself with summing, and not with traversing over a collection of data. But it still relies on foldArrayWith , so it can only sum arrays. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01251))_

- Well, we call arraySum with an array, and it has baked into it a method for traversing the array. Perhaps we could extract both of those things. Let's rearrange our code a bit: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01253))_

- What we've done is turn an array into a function that folds an array with const foldArray = (array) => callRight(foldArrayWith, array); . The sumFoldable function doesn't care what kind of data structure we have, as long as it's foldable. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01255))_

### a look back at functional iterators

- When discussing functions, we looked at the benefits of writing Functional Iterators. We can do the same thing for objects. Here's a stack that has its own functional iterator method: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01502))_

- We could save a step and write collectionSum , a function that folds over any object, provided that the object implements an .iterator method: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01511))_

- If we write a program with the presumption that 'everything is an object,' we can write maps, folds, and filters that work on objects. We just ask the object for an iterator, and work on the iterator. Our functions don't need to know anything about how an object implements iteration, and we get the benefit of lazily traversing our objects. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01513))_

### iterator objects

- Iteration for functions and objects has been around for many, many decades. For simple linear collections like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, functional iterators are the simplest and easiest way to implement iterators. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01516))_

### iterables

- People have been writing iterators since JavaScript was first released in the late 1990s. Since there was no particular standard way to do it, people used all sorts of methods, and their methods returned all sorts of things: Objects with various interfaces, functional iterators, you name it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01524))_

### Generating Iterables

- Let's consider how they work. Whether it's a simple functional iterator, or an iterable object with a .next() method, an iterator is something we call repeatedly until it tells us that it's done. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01595))_

### state machines

- The thing to note here is that our fibonacci generator has three states: generating 0 , generating 1 , and generating everything after that. This isn't a good fit for an iterator, because iterators have one functional entry point and therefore, we'd have to represent our three states explicitly, perhaps using a state pattern 90 : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01623))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-3d2ca956d4a0d0e8"></a>
```
The .iterator() method is defined with shorthand equivalent to iterator: function iterator()
{ ... }. Note that it uses the function keyword, so when we invoke it with stack.iterator(),
JavaScript sets this to the value of stack. But what about the function .iterator() returns? It is
defined with a fat arrow () => { ... }. What is the value of this within that function?
Since JavaScript doesn’t bind this within a fat arrow function, we follow the same rules of variable
scoping as any other variable name: We check in the environment enclosing the function. Although
the .iterator() method has returned, its environment is the one that encloses our () => { ...
} function, and that’s where this is bound to the value of stack.
Therefore, the iterator function returned by the .iterator() method has this bound to the stack
object, even though we call it with iter().

The thing to note here is that our fibonacci generator has three states: generating 0, generating
1, and generating everything after that. This isn’t a good fit for an iterator, because iterators have
one functional entry point and therefore, we’d have to represent our three states explicitly, perhaps
using a state pattern90:
We’ll keep it simple:
// Iteration
let a, b, state = 0;
const fibonacci = () => {
switch (state) {
case 0:
state = 1;
return a = 0;
case 1:
state = 2;
return b = 1;
case 2:
[a, b] = [b, a + b];
return b
}
};
while (true) {
console.log(fibonacci());
}

...
Again, this is not particularly horrendous, but like the recursive example, we’re explicitly greenspun-
ning the natural linear state. In a generator, we write “do this, then this, then this.” In an iterator,
we have to wrap that up and explicitly keep track of what step we’re on.
So we see the same thing: The generation version has state, but it’s implicit in JavaScript’s linear
control flow. Whereas the iteration version must make that state explicit.
javascript’s generators
It would be very nice if we could sometimes write iterators as a .next() method that gets called, and
sometimes write out a generator. Given the title of this chapter, it is not a surprise that JavaScript
makes this possible.
We can write an iterator, but use a generation style of programming. An iterator written in a
generation style is called a generator. To write a generator, we write a function, but we make two
changes:
1. We declare the function using the function * syntax. Not a fat arrow. Not a plain function.
2. We don’t return values or output them to console.log. We “yield” values using the yield
keyword.
When we invoke the function, we get an iterator object back. Let’s start with the degenerate example,
the empty iterator:91
function * empty () {};
empty().next()
//=>
{"done":true}
When we invoke empty, we get an iterator with no elements. This makes sense, because empty never
yields anything. We call its .next() method, but it’s done immediately.
Generator functions can take an argument. Let’s use that to illustrate yield:
91We wrote a generator declaration. We can also write const empty = function * () {} to bind an anonymous generator to the empty keyword,
but we don’t need to do that here.
