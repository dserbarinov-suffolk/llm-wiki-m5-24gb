## Statements

- What's happening is that our main code, the one that accepts the user's incoming data (which we just simulated with a random number generator) is blocking as it sends to the channel because no receiver is available. _(coding_little_go_book.pdf (source-range-23d24eb1-00435))_
- In cases where you need high guarantees that the data is being processed, you probably will want to start blocking the client. In other cases, you might be willing to loosen those guarantees. There are a few popular strategies to do this. The first is to buffer the data. If no worker is available, we want to temporarily store the data in some sort of queue. Channels have this buffering capability built-in. When we created our channel with make , we can give our channel a length: _(coding_little_go_book.pdf (source-range-23d24eb1-00436))_
- You can make this change, but you'll notice that the processing is still choppy. Buffered channels don't add more capacity; they merely provide a queue for pending work and a good way to deal with a sudden spike. In our example, we're continuously pushing more data than our workers can handle. _(coding_little_go_book.pdf (source-range-23d24eb1-00438))_
- You can see that it grows and grows until it fills up, at which point sending to our channel start to block again. _(coding_little_go_book.pdf (source-range-23d24eb1-00441))_
