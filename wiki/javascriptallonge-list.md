# List

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about list:

## Statements

### Recipes with Basic Functions / Partial Application

- These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. 48 If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a 'hole' in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. They are context-agnostic. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00655))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Arrays and Destructuring Arguments

- While we have mentioned arrays briefly, we haven't had a close look at them. Arrays are JavaScript's 'native' representation of lists. Strings are important because they represent writing. Lists are important because they represent ordered collections of things, and ordered collections are a fundamental abstraction for making sense of reality. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00812))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Self-Similarity

- Let's be more specific. Some data structures, like lists, can obviously be seen as a collection of items. Some are empty, some have three items, some forty-two, some contain numbers, some contain strings, some a mixture of elements, there are all kinds of lists. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00880))_

- Let's convert our rules to array literals. The first rule is simple: [] is a list. How about the second rule? We can express that using a spread. Given an element e and a list list , [e, ...list] is a list. We can test this manually by building up a list: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00884))_

### Composing and Decomposing Data / default arguments

- By writing our parameter list as (n, work = 1) => , we're stating that if a second parameter is not provided, work is to be bound to 1 . We can do similar things with our other tail-recursive functions: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01002))_

### Garbage, Garbage Everywhere / some history

- Lists were represented as linked lists of cons cells, with each cell's head pointing to an element and the tail pointing to another cons cell. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01028))_

- Again, it's just extracting a reference from a cons cell, it's very fast. In Lisp, it's blazingly fast because it happens in hardware. There's no making copies of arrays, the time to cdr a list with five elements is the same as the time to cdr a list with 5,000 elements, and no temporary arrays are needed. In JavaScript, it's still much, much, much faster to get all the elements except the head from a linked list than from an array. Getting one reference to a structure that already exists is faster than copying a bunch of elements. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01042))_

### Garbage, Garbage Everywhere / so why arrays

- Well, linked lists are fast for a few things, like taking the front element off a list, and taking the remainder of a list. But not for iterating over a list: Pointer chasing through memory is quite a bit slower than incrementing an index. In addition to the extra fetches to dereference pointers, pointer chasing suffers from cache misses. And if you want an arbitrary item from a list, you have to iterate through the list element by element, whereas with the indexed array you just fetch it. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01050))_

### Plain Old JavaScript Objects

- Lists are not the only way to represent collections of things, but they are the 'oldest' data structure in the history of high level languages, because they map very closely to the way the hardware is organized in a computer. Lists are obviously very handy for homogeneous collections of things, like a shopping list: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01057))_

- Remembering that the name is the first item is error-prone, and being expected to look at user[0][1] and know that we are talking about a surname is unreasonable. So back when lists were the only things available, programmers would introduce constants to make things easier on themselves: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01060))_

### Plain Old JavaScript Objects / revisiting linked lists

- The problem here is that linked lists are constructed back-to-front, but we iterate over them frontto-back. So to copy a list, we have to save all the bits on the call stack and then construct the list from back-to-front as all the recursive calls return. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01106))_

- Mind you, this is still much, much faster than making partial copies of arrays. For a list of length n , wecreated n superfluous nodes and copied n superfluous values. Whereas our naïve array algorithm created 2 n superfluous arrays and copied n 2 superfluous values. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01112))_

### Mutation / building with mutation

- This algorithm makes copies of nodes as it goes, and mutates the last node in the list so that it can splice the next one on. Adding a node to an existing list is risky, as we saw when considering the fact that OneToFive and ThreeToFive share the same nodes. But when we're in the midst of creating a brand new list, we aren't sharing any nodes with any other lists, and we can afford to be more liberal about using mutation to save space and/or time. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01152))_

### Copy on Write

- We've seen how to build lists with arrays and with linked lists. We've touched on an important difference between them: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01220))_

- This is remarkably unsafe. If we know that a list doesn't share any elements with another list, we can safely modify it. But how do we keep track of that? Add a bunch of bookkeeping to track references? We'll end up reinventing reference counting and garbage collection. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01227))_

### Copy on Write / a few utilities / copy-on-read

- So back to the problem of structure sharing. One strategy for avoiding problems is to be pessimistic . Whenever we take the rest of a list, make a copy. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01234))_

### Copy on Write / a few utilities / copy-on-write

- But our new parent and child lists are copies that contain the desired modifications, without interfering with each other: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01244))_

### Copy on Write / Making Data Out Of Functions / a return to backward thinking

- We're passing list what we want done with an empty list, and what we want done with a list that has at least one element. We then ask list to do it, and provide a way for list to call the code we pass in. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01411))_

- Having a list know itself whether it is empty hides implementation information from the code that uses lists. This is a fundamental principle of good design. It is a tenet of Object-Oriented Programming, but it is not exclusive to OOP: We can and should design data structures to hide implementation information from the code that use them, whether we are working with functions, objects, or both. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01415))_


## Technical atoms

### Technical frame 1: Or even: / back on the block

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00245))_

> But no matter how we arrange them, a block with one or more expressions still evaluates to undefined :

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00246))_

<a id="atom-technical-atom-34ea4e035787e576"></a>
```text
//=> undefined
We said that the function returns the result of evaluating a block, and we said that a block is a
(possibly empty) list of JavaScript statements separated by semicolons.21
Something like: { statement1; statement2; statement3; ... ; statementn }
We haven’t discussed these statements. What’s a statement?
There are many kinds of JavaScript statements, but the first kind is one we’ve already met. An
expression is a JavaScript statement. Although they aren’t very practical, these are valid JavaScript
functions, and they return undefined when applied:
() => { 2 + 2 }
() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 }
As we saw with commas above, we can rearrange these functions onto multiple lines when we feel
its more readable that way:
() => {
1 + 1;
2 + 2
}
But no matter how we arrange them, a block with one or more expressions still evaluates to
undefined:
(() => { 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
(() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
(() => {
1 + 1;
2 + 2
})()
//=> undefined
As you can see, a block with one expression does not behave like an expression, and a block with
more than one expression does not behave like an expression constructed with the comma operator:
21You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semi-
colon insertion. Basically, there’s a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in
should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it’s part of
the language’s definition, it’s fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them.
The first sip: Basic Functions
14
(() => 2 + 2)()
//=> 4
(() => { 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
(() => (1 + 1, 2 + 2))()
//=> 4
(() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
So how do we get a function that evaluates a block to return a value when applied? With the return
keyword and any expression:
(() => { return 0 })()
//=> 0
(() => { return 1 })()
//=> 1
(() => { return 'Hello ' + 'World' })()
// 'Hello World'
The return keyword creates a return statement that immediately terminates the function application
and returns the result of evaluating its expression. For example:
(() => {
1 + 1;
return 2 + 2
})()
//=> 4
And also:
(() => {
return 1 + 1;
2 + 2
})()
//=> 2
The return statement is the first statement we’ve seen, and it behaves differently than an expression.
For example, you can’t use one as the expression in a simple function, because it isn’t an expression:
The first sip: Basic Functions
15
(() => return 0)()
//=> ERROR
Statements belong inside blocks and only inside blocks. Some languages simplify this by making
everything an expression, but JavaScript maintains this distinction, so when learning JavaScript we
also learn about statements like function declarations, for loops, if statements, and so forth. We’ll
see a few more of these later.
functions that evaluate to functions
If an expression that evaluates to a function is, well, an expression, and if a return statement can
have any expression on its right side… Can we put an expression that evaluates to a function on the
right side of a function expression?
Yes:
() => () => 0
That’s a function! It’s a function that when applied, evaluates to a function that when applied,
evaluates to 0. So we have a function, that returns a function, that returns zero. Likewise:
() => () => true
That’s a function, that returns a function, that returns true:
(() => () => true)()()
//=> true
We could, of course, do the same thing with a block if we wanted:
() => () => { return true; }
But we generally don’t.
Well. We’ve been very clever, but so far this all seems very abstract. Diffraction of a crystal is
beautiful and interesting in its own right, but you can’t blame us for wanting to be shown a practical
use for it, like being able to determine the composition of a star millions of light years away. So… In
the next chapter, “I’d Like to Have an Argument, Please,” we’ll see how to make functions practical.
The first sip: Basic Functions

Ah. I’d Like to Have an Argument, Please.22

> We're passing list what we want done with an empty list, and what we want done with a list that has at least one element. We then ask list to do it, and provide a way for list to call the code we pass in.

### Technical frame 47: Copy on Write / Making Data Out Of Functions / a return to backward thinking

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01414))_

> The line node === EMPTY presumes a lot of things. It presumes there is one canonical empty list value. It presumes you can compare these things with the === operator. We can fix this with an isEmpty function, but now we're pushing even more knowledge about the structure of lists into the code that uses them.

node === EMPTY
? delayed
: length(node.rest, delayed + 1);
