# gathering

From [[javascriptallonge]].

## Pattern

- Use the source-backed pattern described in [[javascriptallonge-section-gathering-5b2815df]].
- Evidence roles: decision, explanation, example, structured-state.

## Applicability And Rationale

- Here is the most common pattern: Extracting the head and gathering everything but the head from an array: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00833))_
- Sometimes we need to extract arrays from arrays. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00833))_
- car and cdr 57 are archaic terms that go back to an implementation of Lisp running on the IBM 704 computer. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00835))_
- notation does not provide a universal patten-matching capability. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00836))_
- to place the elements of an array inside another array. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00840))_

## Technical Atoms

### Atom 1: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00834)_

```
const [car, ...cdr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
car
//=> 1
cdr
//=> [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Atom 2: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00838)_

```
const [...butLast, last] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//=> ERROR
const [first, ..., last] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//=> ERROR
Now, when we introduced destructuring, we saw that it is kind-of-sort-of the reverse of array literals.
So if
const wrapped = [something];
Then:
const [unwrapped] = something;
What is the reverse of gathering? We know that:
const [car, ...cdr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
What is the reverse? It would be:
const cons = [car, ...cdr];
Let’s try it:
const oneTwoThree = ["one", "two", "three"];
```

### Atom 3: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00839)_

```
Let’s try it:
const oneTwoThree = ["one", "two", "
["zero", ...oneTwoThree]
//=> ["zero","one","two","three"]
```
