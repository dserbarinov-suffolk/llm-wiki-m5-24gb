# Method

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about method:

## Statements

### Composing and Decomposing Data / Tail Calls (and Default Arguments)

- In practice, using a method like this with more than about 50 items in an array may cause some implementations to run very slow, run out of memory and freeze, or cause an error. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-00958))_

### Recipes with Data / Flip / flipping methods

- When we learn about context and methods, we'll see that flip throws the current context away, so it can't be used to flip methods. A small alteration gets the job done: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01465))_

### Served by the Pot: Collections / Iteration and Iterables / iterator objects / Like this:

- Now our .iterator() method is returning an iterator object. When working with objects, we do things the object way. But having started by building functional iterators, we understand what is happening underneath the object's scaffolding. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01547))_

### Served by the Pot: Collections / Iteration and Iterables / iterables

- To ensure that the method would not conflict with any existing code, JavaScript provides a symbol . Symbols are unique constants that are guaranteed not to conflict with existing strings. Symbols are a longstanding technique in programming going back to Lisp, where the GENSYM function generated… You guessed it… Symbols. 88 _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01551))_

- The expression Symbol.iterator evaluates to a special symbol representing the name of the method that objects should use if they return an iterator object. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01552))_

### Served by the Pot: Collections / Generating Iterables

- Let's consider how they work. Whether it's a simple functional iterator, or an iterable object with a .next() method, an iterator is something we call repeatedly until it tells us that it's done. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01621))_

### Lazy and Eager Collections

- Composing an iterable with a mapIterable method cleaves the responsibility for knowing how to map from the fiddly bits of how a linked list differs from a stack _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01759))_

- Over time, this informal 'interface' for collections grows by accretion. Some methods are only added to a few collections, some are added to all. But our objects grow fatter and fatter. We tell ourselves that, well, a collection ought to know how to map itself. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01761))_

### Lazy and Eager Collections / implementing methods with iteration

- Composing an iterable with a mapIterable method cleaves the responsibility for knowing how to map from the fiddly bits of how a linked list differs from a stack. And if we want to create convenience methods, we can reuse common pieces. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01766))_

41 If we don't want to sort out Underscore, we can also write the following: const map = (a, fn) => a.map(fn); , and trust that it works even though we haven't discussed methods yet.
40 Modern JavaScript implementations provide a map method for arrays, but Underscore's implementation also works with older browsers if you are working with that headache.

### Technical frame 7: Served by the Pot: Collections / Generating Iterables

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01625))_

> Well, we've written our iterator as a server . It waits until given a request, and then it returns exactly one item. Then it waits for the next request. There is no concept of pushing numbers out from the iterator, just waiting until a number is pulled out of the iterator by whatever code consumes numbers.

**Atom:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01622))_

> Iterators have to arrange its own state such that when you call them, they compute and return the next item.

### Technical frame 8: Served by the Pot: Collections / Generating Iterables / javascript's generators

**Context:** _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-0e12e052-01663))_

> When we invoke empty , we get an iterator with no elements. This makes sense, because empty never yields anything. We call its .next() method, but it's done immediately.

> We've gone with the full iterable here, a TreeIterable(iterable) returns an iterable that treats iterable as a tree.

> This expression begins with a stack containing 30 elements. The top two are 29 and 28 . It maps to the squares of all 30 numbers, but our code for mapping an iteration returns an iterable that can iterate over the squares of our numbers, not an array or stack of the squares.
