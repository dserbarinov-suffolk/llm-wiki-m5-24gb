# Packages

From [[coding-little-go-book]].

## Technical atoms

> To keep more complicated libraries and systems organized, we need to learn about packages. In Go, package names follow the directory structure of your Go workspace. If we were building a shopping system, we'd probably start with a package name "shopping" and put our source files in $GOPATH/src/shopping/ . We don't want to put everything inside this folder though. For example, maybe we want to isolate some database logic inside its own folder. To achieve this, we create a subfolder at $GOPATH/src/shopping/db . The package name of the files within this subfolder is simply db , but to access it from another package, including the shopping package, we need to import shopping/db . In other words, when you name a package, via the package keyword, you provide a single value, not a complete hierarchy (e.g., "shopping" or "db"). When you import a package, you specify the complete path. Let's try it. Inside your Go workspace's src folder (which we set up in Getting Started of the Introduction), create a new folder called shopping and a subfolder within it called db . Inside of shopping/db , create a file called db.go and add the following code:
