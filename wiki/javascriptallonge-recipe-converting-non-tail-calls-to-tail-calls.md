# converting non-tail-calls to tail-calls

From [[javascriptallonge]].

## Pattern

- Use the source-backed pattern described in [[javascriptallonge-section-converting-non-tail-calls-to-tail-calls-88056a4f]].
- Evidence roles: decision, constraint, procedure, example, structured-state.

## Applicability And Rationale

- The obvious solution is push the 1 + work into the call to length . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00958))_
- Now that we've seen how it works, we can clean up the 0 + numberToBeAdded business. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00960))_
- This version of length calls uses lengthDelaysWork , and JavaScript optimizes that not to take up memory proportional to the length of the string. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00963))_
- We can map over large arrays without incurring all the memory and performance overhead of non-tail-calls. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00967))_
- And this basic transformation from a recursive function that does not make a tail call, into a recursive function that calls itself in tail position, is a bread-and-butter pattern for programmers using a language that incorporates tail-call optimization. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00967))_

## Technical Atoms

### Atom 1: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00959)_

```
const lengthDelaysWork = ([first, ...rest], numberToBeAdded) =>
first === undefined
? 0 + numberToBeAdded
: lengthDelaysWork(rest, 1 + numberToBeAdded)
lengthDelaysWork(["foo", "bar", "baz"], 0)
//=> 3
```

### Atom 2: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00961)_

```
const lengthDelaysWork = ([first, ...rest], numberToBeAdded) =>
first === undefined
? numberToBeAdded
: lengthDelaysWork(rest, 1 + numberToBeAdded)
const length = (n) =>
lengthDelaysWork(n, 0);
```

### Atom 3: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00962)_

```
Or we could use partial application:
const callLast = (fn, ...args) =>
(...remainingArgs) =>
fn(...remainingArgs, ...args);
const length = callLast(lengthDelaysWork, 0);
length(["foo", "bar", "baz"])
//=> 3
```

### Atom 4: `code-block`

_Source: javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00964)_

```
const mapWithDelaysWork = (fn, [first, ...rest], prepend) =>
first === undefined
? prepend
: mapWithDelaysWork(fn, rest, [...prepend, fn(first)]);
const mapWith = callLast(mapWithDelaysWork, []);
mapWith((x) => x * x, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
//=> [1,4,9,16,25]
We can use it with ridiculously large arrays:
```
