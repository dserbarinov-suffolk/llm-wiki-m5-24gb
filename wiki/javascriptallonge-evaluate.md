# Evaluate

What [[javascriptallonge]] covers about evaluate:

## Statements

### reference types

- They look the same, but if you examine them with === , you see that they are different. Every time you evaluate an expression (including typing something in) to create an array, you're creating a new, distinct value even if it appears to be the same as some other array value. As we'll see, this is true of many other kinds of values, including functions , the main subject of this book. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00134))_

### functions and identities

- Like arrays, every time you evaluate an expression to produce a function, you get a new function that is not identical to any other function, even if you use the same expression to generate it. 'Function' is a reference type. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00173))_

### undefined

- No matter how you evaluate undefined , you get an identical value back. undefined is a value that means 'I don't have a value.' But it's still a value :-) _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00216))_

### back on the block

- But no matter how we arrange them, a block with one or more expressions still evaluates to undefined : _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00237))_

### it's always the environment

- The first function is the result of currying a the second function. Calling a curried function with only some of its arguments is sometimes called partial application b . Some programming languages automatically curry and partially evaluate functions without the need to manually nest them. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00351))_

### Functions

- Block bodies evaluate to whatever is returned with the return keyword, or to undefined . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00629))_

### truthiness and the ternary operator

- JavaScript inherited an operator from the C family of languages, the ternary operator. It's the only operator that takes three arguments. It looks like this: first ? second : third . It evaluates first , and if first is 'truthy', it evaluates second and that is its value. If first is not truthy, it evaluates third and that is its value. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00750))_

- Wecertainly don't want JavaScript trying to evaluate deleteRecord(currentRecord) unless isAuthorized(currentUser) returns true . _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00756))_

### evaluation time

- JavaScript evaluates the quasi-literal when the function is invoked and the quasi-literal inside the function's body is evaluated. Thus, name is not bound to "Harry" , it is bound to 'Arthur Dent' , the value of the parameter when the function is invoked. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01491))_

### iterables

- The expression Symbol.iterator evaluates to a special symbol representing the name of the method that objects should use if they return an iterator object. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-01527))_

//=> undefined
We said that the function returns the result of evaluating a block, and we said that a block is a
(possibly empty) list of JavaScript statements separated by semicolons.21
Something like: { statement1; statement2; statement3; ... ; statementn }
We haven’t discussed these statements. What’s a statement?
There are many kinds of JavaScript statements, but the first kind is one we’ve already met. An
expression is a JavaScript statement. Although they aren’t very practical, these are valid JavaScript
functions, and they return undefined when applied:
() => { 2 + 2 }
() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 }
As we saw with commas above, we can rearrange these functions onto multiple lines when we feel
its more readable that way:
() => {
1 + 1;
2 + 2
}
But no matter how we arrange them, a block with one or more expressions still evaluates to
undefined:
(() => { 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
(() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
(() => {
1 + 1;
2 + 2
})()
//=> undefined
As you can see, a block with one expression does not behave like an expression, and a block with
more than one expression does not behave like an expression constructed with the comma operator:
21You can also separate statements with line breaks. Readers who follow internet flame-fests may be aware of something called automatic semi-
colon insertion. Basically, there’s a step where JavaScript looks at your code and follows some rules to guess where you meant to put semicolons in
should you leave them out. This feature was originally created as a kind of helpful error-correction. Some programmers argue that since it’s part of
the language’s definition, it’s fair game to write code that exploits it, so they deliberately omit any semicolon that JavaScript will insert for them.
The first sip: Basic Functions
14
(() => 2 + 2)()
//=> 4
(() => { 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
(() => (1 + 1, 2 + 2))()
//=> 4
(() => { 1 + 1; 2 + 2 })()
//=> undefined
So how do we get a function that evaluates a block to return a value when applied? With the return
keyword and any expression:
(() => { return 0 })()
//=> 0
(() => { return 1 })()
//=> 1
(() => { return 'Hello ' + 'World' })()
// 'Hello World'
The return keyword creates a return statement that immediately terminates the function application
and returns the result of evaluating its expression. For example:
(() => {
1 + 1;
return 2 + 2
})()
//=> 4
And also:
(() => {
return 1 + 1;
2 + 2
})()
//=> 2
The return statement is the first statement we’ve seen, and it behaves differently than an expression.
For example, you can’t use one as the expression in a simple function, because it isn’t an expression:
The first sip: Basic Functions
15
(() => return 0)()
//=> ERROR
Statements belong inside blocks and only inside blocks. Some languages simplify this by making
everything an expression, but JavaScript maintains this distinction, so when learning JavaScript we
also learn about statements like function declarations, for loops, if statements, and so forth. We’ll
see a few more of these later.
functions that evaluate to functions
If an expression that evaluates to a function is, well, an expression, and if a return statement can
have any expression on its right side… Can we put an expression that evaluates to a function on the
right side of a function expression?
Yes:
() => () => 0
That’s a function! It’s a function that when applied, evaluates to a function that when applied,
evaluates to 0. So we have a function, that returns a function, that returns zero. Likewise:
() => () => true
That’s a function, that returns a function, that returns true:
(() => () => true)()()
//=> true
We could, of course, do the same thing with a block if we wanted:
() => () => { return true; }
But we generally don’t.
Well. We’ve been very clever, but so far this all seems very abstract. Diffraction of a crystal is
beautiful and interesting in its own right, but you can’t blame us for wanting to be shown a practical
use for it, like being able to determine the composition of a star millions of light years away. So… In
the next chapter, “I’d Like to Have an Argument, Please,” we’ll see how to make functions practical.

Ah. I’d Like to Have an Argument, Please.22
