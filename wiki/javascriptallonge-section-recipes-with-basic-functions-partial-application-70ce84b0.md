## Statements

- These two recipes are for quickly and simply applying a single argument, either the leftmost or rightmost. 48 If you want to bind more than one argument, or you want to leave a 'hole' in the argument list, you will need to either use a generalized partial recipe, or you will need to repeatedly apply arguments. They are context-agnostic. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00643))_
- As noted above, our partial recipe allows us to create functions that are partial applications of functions that are context aware. We'd need a different recipe if we wish to create partial applications of object methods. _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00645))_
- We take it a step further, and can use gathering and spreading to allow for partial application with more than one argument: _(javascriptallonge.pdf (source-range-c98ab3e6-00648))_
